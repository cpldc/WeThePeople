				<strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.OMG! What is that smell?</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems in school today is hygiene. There are a lot of students who have problems with body odor. The body sweats, which can lead to odor. One needs to wear deodorant in order to not stink. This means that students should bathe more often and use a combination of items such as deodorant, cologne, perfume or other fragrances.</p>

<p>Personal hygiene plays an important part in your life, and it can protect us and others from germs. Washing hands and body is a start. Making sure you cover your coughs and sneezes. Use such things as hand sanitizer to kill germs from coughing and sneezing.</p>
<p>“I wash my hands every time I touch something and use hand sanitizer every time I cough,” said South Shore School of Leadership senior Daronica Ray.</p>
<p>So what can a person do if someone next to them had a body odor?</p>
<p>“I would pull the student to the side and tell them that people are talking about them, and they smell,” Daronica said. “And if their breath stinks? I would offer them a piece of gum or I would just shout out and say ‘Does anybody want some gum?’”		</p>
