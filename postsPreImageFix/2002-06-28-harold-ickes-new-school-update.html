				The December 1999 RJ first revealed that the residents of 2233 S. Federal St. would feel some of the pain of progress.</p>
<p>The end finally came in recent months, when 65 families received word  they would have only five weeks to vacate the premises that had been  placed on a prioritized schedule to be demolished. Zip! Zap! No  questions allowed. Just be ready for the movers because they will come.  And come they did.<!--more--><br />
The movers came with disregard for the fact that the kitchens in each  apartment had been renovated merely three months before. New floor tile,  kitchen cabinets and stoves were installed just prior to when the  eviction notices were issued. But CHA pressed on with the upheaval of  families of long standing, young families with infant children, and  seniors comfortable in a familiar neighborhood, all of whom were  resigned to facing the pain of progress.</p>
<p>An earlier victim of the pain of progress was the nearby office building  at 55 W. Cermak Blvd., which  stood adjacent to 2233 S. Federal and also was an integral part of the  community. This building once held the Chicago Housing Authority's  Occupancy Department, the CHA Police Department and the CHA Credit  Union, among other departments. At one time, an expensive mosaic tile adorned the walls of the main  lobby at 55 W. Cermak. This mosaic was treasured by all who visited the  building. I wonder what happened to yet another displaced treasure.</p>
<p>The residents were informed of the change years ago. On Nov. 18, 1999, a  community meeting was held to inform the residents of plans for new,  cutting-edge developments on the site of the office building at 55 W.  Cermak and 2233 S. Federal. The site would be used for a new  institution, now known as the National Teaching Academy of Chicago. But was the residents' sacrifice worth it?</p>
<p>This reporter was very gratified to have had an interview with Dr. B.  Terry-Lundy, one of the main players in the development of the  state-of-the-art curriculum that is to be offered to the classroom  students and student teachers who will be coming from the universities  in Chicago that will connect their teacher programs to the new  curriculum being taught.</p>
<p>RJ: "Will there be a place for Parent Volunteers?"</p>
<p>BTL: "We haven't covered that aspect of our staffing. However, I anticipate parental involvement."</p>
<p>RJ: "What can the community look forward to in after-school programming?"</p>
<p>BTL: "At the end of a regular school day, 2:30 p.m., a new staff will  take over and a complete community school will open for enrichment  classes for  high achievers. There will also be more assistance for low achievers,  with no distinctions attached to who is eligible."</p>
<p>RJ: "Will this community school be available to the adult residents?"</p>
<p>BTL: "Yes. There will be parent academic classes. Health, fitness and  wellness classes. Physical education programs will center around  nutrition. Healthy, normal physical fitness with swimming included."</p>
<p>RJ: "This sounds extremely exciting to me.  However, what plans do you  have for helping parents help their children with computer skills?"</p>
<p>BTL: "There will be computer lab after 2:30 where they can learn how to  help children at home. There will also be a time when they can come into  the  classroom and sit in on classes with their children."</p>
<p>RJ: "What measures will be taken to combat poor and irregular attendance?"</p>
<p>BTL: "The whole curriculum is designed not to be traditional learning.  It will be real world learning, hands-on situations. Interesting enough  to attract better attendance and to allow students to enjoy school more. "The classroom is all-inclusive, meaning no separation of students with  learning disabilities. There will be special education teachers  available to  assist each student."</p>
<p>Terry-Lundy projected a complete overview of the state-of-the-art  curriculum. He said it would be to the advantage of every adult who  lives within the boundaries of this new educational breakthrough to stay  alert to the dates and times of the open house.</p>
<p>He urged residents to visit the premises, become connected and become  educationally enriched. The regular school day hours will be from 9 a.m.  to 2:30 p.m. with a closed campus lunch period.</p>
<p>The main address will be on Cermak Road, also known as 22nd Street.  The  Chicago Public School  neighborhood boundaries are 18th Street to the north, 24th Street to the  south, the railway on the west and Michigan on the east to 22nd Street,  and then 22nd Street to the lake.</p>
<p>Teachers who are presently teaching at other CPS schools and have taught  a minimum of four years will come to the Academy and spend 3 weeks to  learn</p>
<p>more about engaging children in learning by using proven research and  instructional strategies to improve student achievement. The purpose of  this tactic is for the teachers to become strong and reflective and to  take back what they've learned to the faculty of their school.</p>
<p>By taking turns, more than one person from the school learns the same  things. Together, they form a network of in-school, experienced  teachers.</p>
<p>Because the huge community center attached to the academy will house the  physical education department, I was very interested in speaking to Tom  Poulos, the physical education director.</p>
<p>Poulos explained that the new techniques for involving the students will  have funding and work with a lifetime skills building program.  Many  activities will focus on individualization.   However, intramural games  will be designed to fine-tune good  sportsmanship and healthy fun. A  sensory motor program will be included to try and show the connection  between physical education and academics.</p>
<p>A great idea, say many residents. It sounds like a new  and good thing.</p>
<p>The icing on the cake is the extensive daily preschool programs for  infants and toddlers up to 3 years old. All learning programs will be  public and administered at no cost. Pre-schoolers ages 3 to 5 will have  their own educational program geared toward giving them the best  possible early childhood learning experience. The program will be geared  toward fitting the needs of each child.</p>
<p>The hours of attendance for infants through toddlers will be 8 a.m. to 6  p.m. For the pre-kindergarteners, 3- to 5-year-olds, the hours will be  8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. To those parents who would need this service,  their children will be among the first ever to attend school at the age  of 0. Mind boggling!</p>
<p>Being a longtime resident of Harold Ickes, I have many wonderful  pictures of before, during and after the completion of this  state-of-the-art educational site. I intend to share a collage of the  photos with the school so that the community can enjoy them.</p>
<p>It is my sincere hope that each child that was displaced for the  edification of the Academy can return with his or her parents and become  a complete and satisfied participant in the birth of a whole new  educational system.</p></p>
