<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> <em>The following story was written by a student in our Urban Youth International Journalism Program in partnership with the New Memorial Baptize Church. Students participated in a field trip to see <a title="state of deception" href="http://www.ushmm.org/propaganda/">“State of Deception,”</a> a traveling exhibit from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. The UYIJP is generously funded by the <a href="http://www.mccormickfoundation.org/">McCormick Foundation</a>.</em></p>
<p>My experience at the Field Museum viewing the Holocaust exhibit was interesting and learning-full. I learned a lot about the leader Adolf Hitler and how he was able to persuade people that what he did was right. Adolf Hitler used propaganda to persuade people. Some examples of propaganda were posters, letters and pictures. This was a huge part of the Holocaust.<br />
The Holocaust itself was a movement basically. Nazi soldiers who were under the leadership of Adolf Hitler killed and tortured many Jews only because they were Jewish. <span style="font-size: 13.5pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: JA; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><!--more--></span></p>

<p>These Jews were put in Concentration camps where they were abused, used and killed! Many were killed by gas chambers which they were tricked like they were taking a shower. Another way they were killed was by gunshot or by being burned alive. America knew of the Holocaust because the Jews came to America on ships to escape the Holocaust. America turned them away, in some instances.<br />
In my opinion, the Holocaust was horrible. It was discriminating toward Jews who were innocent and taken advantage of. There are rumors out there that Hitler was Jewish himself but these are not true. Six-10 million people, not only Jews but anyone who was not the same race as the Nazis, Gypsies and homosexuals were killed during this time.<br />
This sad event ended started in 1933 and ended on 1945. Adolf Hitler committed suicide on April 30, 1945. He knew that it wasn't going to end good for him. Therefore, he killed himself and that ended this tragic event!</p>
