				In March 2004, at  Westinghouse Career Academy, 3301 W. Franklin Boulevard, a female  attendance clerk was beaten by a student during a black-out.</p>
<p>At Wells Community Academy, 936 N. Ashland, two male students were shot.   A week later, one of the victims was shot by a student again.</p>
<p>At Phillips Academy, 244 E. Pershing Road, the very school in which the  Bureau of Safety and Security for the Chicago Public School System is  located, a male student was beaten.<br />

And recently, a female student at Dyett Academy, 555 E. 51st Street was  beaten by a gang of girls inside the school.  Violence occurred despite the police presence.  When asked what is being  done about violence in schools, Chicago Public Schools Deputy Press  Secretary Michael Vaughn said, "In review of our security there was a  determination that the enrollment in [Phillips and Dyett] merit  additional security resources," which resulted in a stronger police  presence in and around the schools.</p>
<p>According to Vaughn, CPS conducted a High School Security Audit in  January 2003 to determine whether schools were allocating enough  resources toward safety.</p>
<p>He said CPS looked at all security aspects to make sure schools had  proper organizational procedures to handle security and disciplinary  issues in the schools.  He said that activity that happens inside and  outside of the schools that impacts the safety of the student is handled  according to the degree of the violence.</p>
<p>Parent Sandra Carter, whose daughter Candace attends Westinghouse, said  she thinks CPS is doing as much as possible to deter violence, but added  "They're going to have to get stricter rules for these kids to abide by  . . . You just hope from day to day that nothing happens to your  child."</p>
<p>Carter said violence was curbed at Westinghouse because there are always  a lot of police cars around the school. Candace agreed, telling  Residents' Journal that if it weren't for the police cars, she thinks  there would be more violence.</p>
