				**Happy New Year Everyone!**
I am pleased to say that I have made it through another year and am looking forward to the blessings that the New Year will bring me. I want to encourage everyone to make this year better than the last. Some may say that is easier said than done, but it is possible. Perseverance, patience and the power within are the keys to success.
What about all of those New Year’s resolutions? Stick to them! Lose those ten pounds, make those extra dollars, buy that new car, etc.! There’s nothing left to do but to do it!

Do you ever look around and wonder why is it that some people have more than others? Why is it that some people are happier than others? Believe it or not, it all comes from within. If you want something bad enough, you can go out and get it. You have to work hard for what you really want. If you want to be happier, you can rearrange some things in your life and put them into perfect place. It’s all about sitting back and really thinking about what can make you a better, healthier, happier person.
One of the life lessons I’ve learned, just recently, is not to go with the flow of life but to get in a boat and ride the waves. Not only will I be in more control, but it’s so much more fun!
Sometimes, I will fall out of the boat and end up underwater. It’s scary! Nerve wracking! What to do? It’s all about taking control of the situation and not letting the situation control you. I feel that I have come too far to drown, so guess what I am going to do? I may have to fight, I may have to struggle, but I will get my head above water again.
Life is never easy. Think about it: if it was, how would we learn? Books can only teach us so much.
