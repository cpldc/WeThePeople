				**Editorâ€™s Note:** The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.


The Wells is a place of many different flavors


Plenty of drowning souls that could all use a savior


Like every community it has its ups and downs


A place where you'll see many a smile turned upside down


It used to be a place that I thought was full of danger


But now that I've been here awhile I've made some friends out of strangers


There were times that the feet and fists of others tried to hurt me


It's part of an everyday fight for survival where they show no mercy


Leases get terminated here for non compliance


And the media would have you believe that everyone here is violent


Though it's not a tourist attraction like Wisconsin Dells


When it's gone we will never forget the Wells


The little things like hurting my knee when I was riding my bike and fell


To when I got hit by a car and my cousin ran to tell


It may not mean much to others, but to us it's a landmark


Things like the writing on the walls could even be viewed as art


A lot of our friends and family are gone from the Wells most of them have moved


The day is on the way that we'll wake up and the Wells will be new and improved


When that day comes we'll be ready for a new start


But know without a doubt, the Wells will always hold a special place in our heart
