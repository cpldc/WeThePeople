				**Editor’s Note:** The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.


At 2:55 p.m. as the bell rings for dismissal, I hurry to my locker to get my things. As I put my coat on, I only have one thing on my mind: Facebook.


Facebook addiction plays a major role in my life today.


<!--more-->“I hardly talk on the phone, and I rarely watch TV because of the amount of time I spend on Facebook,” said South Shore School of Leadership senior Joseph Davis.


Facebook is just the latest incarnation of MySpace, which replaced Friendster, which replaced talking on the phone, which replaced actually talking to someone one-on-one.


With the ever-changing technologies and the ease with which you can stay in touch with someone while exerting little effort, social networking Web sites have become a dominant force for teens.


It allows for picture sharing, instant messaging, private messages, status updates and even the opportunity to leave a comment on what your friends write on their pages.


I interviewed several teenagers, and I discovered the main reason people create accounts on Facebook and MySpace is because it’s a source.


“If you want to know the latest drama with your peers, then create a Facebook account,” said South Shore School of Leadership senior Reginald Branch.
