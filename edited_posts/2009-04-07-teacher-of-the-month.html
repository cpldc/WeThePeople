				**Editor’s Note:** The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.


KS: Why did you come to this school?


Ms. G: A professor of mine worked with inner city youth and his stories inspired me.


KS: If you could, what would you change about your classes?


Ms. G: I would spend more time with my students so I could get through to them, especially the ones that need the most help

KS: Why do you think the kids like you?


MS.G: To some extent, I think it’s because they see I understand their struggle and because that we open up to one another.


KS: Why did you choose to teach social studies?


MS.G: I like to teach and talk about justice and I want to teach students that individuals can make a difference, even if it’s just a small one.


KS: Do you have any pets?


MS.G: All Dobermans, Mr. Otto, Middle Puppy and Fergie (Ferg Berg)…rescued 4/08. My dogs by day, Doberman ninjas by night.


-Every day you take on hardship and adversity…you endure. You remain strong…keep going and still manage to smile. Because of that, I do not only teach you, you teach me too! You fill my life with meaning and give me a sense of purpose. Ms. G
