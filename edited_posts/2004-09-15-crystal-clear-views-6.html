				**Hey everyone, happy summer  time! Even though Mother's Day has passed, I still thought I'd write  about motherhood. Now that I am older and have a family of my own,  motherhood has a different meaning for me, especially since my own  mother has passed. When I was younger, it was all about showing mom how  much she meant to me, how much I loved and appreciated her. I always  wanted to let her know that she was the most important person in my  life. That's where the flowers, cards and gifts came in. What am I  supposed to do now? She still is so very special to me, but she isn't  here.

Having a daughter of my own eases the pain. I look at my baby and see  how much she loves me and appreciates me. The feeling is incredible and  unexplainable. So if I feel this way, my mother must have felt this way.  Somewhere, somehow, she still does. I try to keep her memory alive and  thank her by being the best mom that I can be. Sometimes it's hard and  sometimes it's easier than I ever imagined because I am following my  mom's example.
It's crazy. Sometimes, I will act a certain way with my child and I will  get flashbacks. I will say things to my daughter and wonder to myself,  "Did I just really say that?" And do you know what the best part is? In  return, my daughter will do and say the same things I said and did.
The other day, her father was going to take her to daycare, and she was  standing near the front door, ready to leave. I said, "Bye Baby, have a  good day. Mommy loves you." My mother use to say this to me every day,  and I can't imagine letting my baby start her day without telling her.  For the first time, she turned around, looked me right in my eye, smiled  really big and said, "I lu loo, Mommy." Oh my goodness! Heart be still!  These are the moments with my daughter that I will carry with me no  matter where I go.
I know now that even if my mother is in another place far and better,  she still feels the love and the adoration I had for her. I like to  think she tucked away deep in her heart these strong feelings to help  her through her different journeys. I do the same as I make my way  through motherhood.
I have enjoyed sharing my feelings with you readers, and I hope that you  all celebrate motherhood. Mothers are very special people. They deserve  all the love and sweetness that your heart can produce, though not  necessarily in the form of flowers, cards or gifts. When was the last  time you gave your mother a hug and a kiss and told her thank you, for  no reason at all? These are best the gifts you can give.
