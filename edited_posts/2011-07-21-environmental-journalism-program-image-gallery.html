For the past few weeks, Chicago youth involved in the Eco Youth Reporters program, funded by the <a href="http://www.mccormickfoundation.org/" target="_blank">McCormick Foundation</a>,  have explored global environmental issues on a local level.  They  interviewed local experts on topics ranging from coal plants to the  dangers of invasive fish species.  Under the guidance of award-winning  reporter Kari Lydersen and Michigan State University's <a href="http://ej.msu.edu/about.php" target="_blank">Knight Center for Environmental Journalism</a>,  these journalists are learning to effectively cover the larger  environmental issues and spread awareness within the Chicago community  through print stories, photography and video documentation.
