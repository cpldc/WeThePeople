For the second year, the Chicago Blackhawks met and greeted 61 Chicago public housing youth during their “Event to Inspire” Hockey Clinic sponsored by 1 World Sports, at Johnny’s Ice House, 1350 W. Madison Street on January 19, 2012.


During the three-hour sports clinic, the girls and boys, ages 6 to 12 all from CHA family developments, laced up their ice skates and were instructed in the fundamentals of hockey.


Later, they applied the new skills they learned from Kevin Delahny, the Blackhawks skills coach, to score puck-shots on Blackhawks goalie Ray Emery.

The event aimed “to foster leadership and teamwork in youth through sports and other recreational activities,” according to the CHA press release.


CHA Youth Opportunities Program instructor Dorian Figures told Residents’ Journal during the event the youth were recruited through the CHA Family Works Program, and the Chicago Park District. Figures added that the kids also had to do a workbook on their hockey and other sports activities.

“This is not just about skating. They are also here to learn about sportsmanship. They have to do a workbook centered around sports and different other activities. They have ten different goals that they’re responsible for,” Figures said.
