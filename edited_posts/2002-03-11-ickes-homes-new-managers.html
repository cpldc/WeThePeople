				The Woodlawn Organization (TWO), the new managers  of the Harold Ickes Homes, is struggling to do a good job of managing  the regular management-resident connections.  Take, for instance, the  monthly rent statements. I have regularly received mine five to ten days  past the first of the month.  I wait and hold on to my money order but  it doesn't come. I pay my rent and get a receipt without the rent  statement to attach to my money order. I think, "Oh well. Maybe next  month."
In March, I got a statement with two months unpaid rent showing. Well, I  know I paid February's rent but I got nervous because if they made such  a glaring mistake, how safe are your funds? By April 11, 2002 no rent  statement yet.  However, when I paid on the sixth of the month, TWO issued me a 14-day  notice. Why? I wasn't behind in paying rent.   "Don't worry," the clerk said. "You've paid your rent.  "It's in your  lease that after five days, without paying, you're due a 14 day notice."   <!--more-->


**Service Connectors**


The Service Connector program gave the residents some shaky moments last  month when they were informing residents that every lease holder and  adult living in Ickes would have to register with them, giving them all  their personal information, including social security numbers.
Well, it just didn't figure. If I did not need to be connected to a  service through their office, why should I have to release all of my  vital information to them?
I called the Department of Human Services and spoke to Mattie Hunter,  director of the Service Connector program.  She assured me that "every  resident doesn't have to give of their personal information  automatically. Only those persons who go to the office to ask for  assistance to be connected to a specific service."
I was relieved and eager to inform the residents of this fact.  Despite  the initial misgivings, the Service Connector program is designed to  respect a community of nearly forgotten people by bringing to them a  permanent office. The Service Connector program also sponsored a day of fulfillment by  bringing representatives from some of the city's major service providers  together in a welcoming concert and open house.
Harold Ickes Homes' Henry Booth House Community Center, also a service  providing agency headed by Bill Goss, graciously opened its doors to  accommodate the first "integration activity."
Angela Bailey of TWO met and greeted the residents as they explored the  opportunities on hand. This reporter was pleasantly surprised at the  variety of public services present that are commonly known to other  communities and residents.
I spoke to Bob Taylor of "Affordable Access," a financial management company.
<ul />**RJ:** Tell me about Affordable Access. What do you tell a person?


**BT:** I tell them about how not to make mistakes with (spending) their money.


**RJ:** Suppose people don't get a lot of money. What then?


**BT:** We show you how to get whatever you make and make it work for you.


**RJ: ** In what ways?


**BT:** We show you how not to let the government take too much from your check and how not to buy too much insurance.


**RJ:** What if they already have an insurance agent and too much insurance?


**BT:** I can point out that an insurance agent is not necessarily interested in money management.


**RJ:** Is there any more you do to educate individuals?


**BT:** I sit down with the people and talk about money, time, value&amp;how to get your money to work for you.


**RJ:** In what ways?


**BT:** How not to spend money when they don't want to, need to, or can't afford to.


Taylor said his service may be the key to dispelling many financial woes and planning for the future of the whole family.
Other service providers were just as eager to welcome the residents and to assure them of the integrity of their services.
LaRabida Children's Hospital passed out vital information about  children's asthma, a sometimes fatal disease. Staff members spoke at  length with concerned parents and invited them to seek the assistance of  the hospital's medical staff and to visit the lakefront facility.
The newly developed South Side YMCA brought information on programming  opportunities for all ages.  Summer day camping for children,  introduction to computer lessons for seniors, swimming and exercise for  all adults. All these offerings are family oriented and can be utilized  for nominal fees. Besides theses good qualities, the site of the South  Side YMCA, is localized and easy to get to.
The University of Chicago joined the bandwagon with their Pediatric  Immunization Program (PIP). They offered information and invited to  enroll small children.
A company call Strive presented an invitation to young fathers who did  not live with their children to join a program called Successful  Fathers.
The description of the four-week job readiness workshop could encourage  many young men who are floundering outside of their families to seek a  way to turn their lives around and make a difference in the lives of  their children.  I spoke to Shawn Slatton at one Strive location, 4910  S. King Drive. She was able to report a successful track record with 70  percent of clients who have gone through the steps to improve their life  styles successfully per month.  The parenting classes and support  groups for fathers to talk about what it takes to be a responsible  parent could be a real breakthrough for one of our community's now  serious social issues.
