				**Editor’s Note:** The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.
Oh my gosh … I just got diagnosed with senioritis!
The “itis” has hit South Shore. Run because you’re next!  	Senioritis is a disease. It is an illness that students get in their last year of school.
Senioritis comes from the word “senior” and the suffix “itis,” which means a disease characterized by inflammation, often caused by an infection.
<!--more-->Some symptoms are a lack of motivation, a drop in academic performance and going through classes with little concentration.
Senioritis also consists of laziness, lack of studying, repeated absences, tardiness, a bad attitude and procrastination.
Students catch senioritis because of the stress of their senior year or because they are focusing on their college process and forget they’re still responsible for their school assignments.
Seniors often jeopardize their senior year just because they are overwhelmingly excited for graduation.   	South Shore School of Leadership seniors have caught it.
Margaret Baskerville said, “I do not have senioritis. I am just lazy and forgetful.” 	But according to Ms. Koncir, it is not just “senioritis, it is freshmanitis, sophomoritis and junioritis,” so she just calls it “studentitis.”
Danielle Lashay said, “I really don’t know what senioritis is… (she) says it make her feel old.” 	Seniors believe that if they pass three years of school they can just blow off the last year of school.
Elbert Brooks said he doesn’t have to do anything else.
He has done enough his last three years; it’s now time to relax. He also feels “that school is a waste of time. I guess that’s the ‘itis’ talking.”
“Students think they have reached a mark because it’s their last year,” Mr. Mbaye said. He went on to say that “students are comfortable with being incomplete.”
Mr. Mbaye believes it happens “because students are irresponsible. It becomes a way of life for most of the people in our community.
These students have invested in a daunting task. They make that their job.”  	Ms. Koncir says that “students look for anything, not just ‘itis.’ If we give it to them they will take it,” meaning “if you allow them to use senioritis as an excuse, they will.”
She also said that “teachers need to challenge their students more during that period.”
Another major symptom of the senioritis is that seniors daydream about everything they want to do instead of finishing what they are supposed to do.
As a student, education is your job. We should all have a positive attitude about it, but Elbert Brooks said he has senioritis so “screw school.”
Danielle Lashay has “schoolitis.” she had it “ever since kindergarten.”
Ms. Koncir feels that “no one has the luxury of senioritis. Or for that case no one has the luxury of ‘studentitis.’ The only cure is graduation.”
