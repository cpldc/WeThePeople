				**Editor’s Note:** The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.


People wonder why schools don’t have healthier foods.


South Shore High School and suburban schools are different, health-wise. Some Chicago Public Schools people think and say school food helps make children obese.

South Shore, like most public schools, has nachos, pizza, hamburgers, fried chicken, etc. These are greasy foods that add on fat. We have healthy foods but it doesn’t out-weigh our other foods.


Kids do have a popular vote in the food. You have to eat lunch during school. You eat what you like, which is usually unhealthy food. The school serves and sells it to help raise money for us. But students also sell healthy food like fruit bars, Rice Krispie Treats and Fig Newtons: these are some things that some suburban schools have.


This also shows that the government cares for them more because they’re looking out for their health. Also, their lunch menu is different. It consists of more variety of salads, strawberries and veggie burgers.
