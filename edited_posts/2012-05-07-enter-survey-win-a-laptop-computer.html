Dear Friends :


We The People Media is asking people to fill out an on-line survey we developed with the Local Advisory Council resident leaders. Anyone that fills it out gets the chance to win a laptop computer or a gift card!


The survey is geared toward current CHA residents as well as former residents, but we're looking for everybody's opinion. Feel free to copy the link and send it out to others:
