				**Editor’s Note:** The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.
It’s crazy how when you get to high school in your first year, you think that it’s good not going to class, walking the halls, just having fun, and not doing the school work.
You think you can make it up. It’s just the first year and at the end of the day, you don’t know that you will eventually have to go to night school for all the times you messed up and didn’t do right when you had the time to do it.

One day, you will look back and see night school is not fun. When all your friends are outside having a good time going out, you have to go to night school for four to five hours thinking about how you should have done the work the first time around.
“I spend my time in night school thinking I should have done this the first time around,” junior Victor Griffin said.
Night school runs form 3:45pm to 7:45pm Monday through Thursday. Many students take classes all four days, making it seem as if they are living at school.
“Twelve hour days tend to add up,” said senior Krystal Spencer.
For some, four days of night school is required in order for them to graduate on time.
“I am taking two classes this semester of night school in order to be on track to graduate,” said junior Trena Fleming.
These students all are working extra hard to make up classes they failed the first time around. The choice is up to you: play now, but pay later.
