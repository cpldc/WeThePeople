				**Editorâ€™s Note:** The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.
When the first day came that I had a chance to see the sun


My mom and dad were happy that my life had begun


When I was a shorty I used to get on my mom's nerves


I used to like watching old folks sit on the porch and throw bread to the birds


In the summer I would leave the house as soon as I awoke


Listening to all the kids say, "It's time to go to chokes"


At night time the Wells is what's happening


If somebody says something wrong we about to get it cracking


Playing ball and going to parties is all I used to do


Nowadays people say that the Wells is through


Wherever we move it won't be as good


As the days gone by and me and my hood
