				****Dear Crystal:**


I am a 17-year-old girl and I was having a lot of problems with my mother. So I ran away from home. I’ve been on the streets for about three weeks now.


I used to stay with my older ex-boyfriend but he kicked me out last week. Since then, I’ve been staying with different friends.


I realize now there is no place like home and I want to go back. The problem is, I don’t think my mom wants me back. I’ve seen her about four times since I left and she acts as if she doesn’t care.<!--more-->


For example, when I was staying with my ex, she stopped by once, gave me a couple of dollars, wished me luck, and told him to take care of me.


What can I do to build back the bridge I have burned?


**- Regretful Runaway**


**Dear Runaway:**


I really hope that you haven’t burned any bridges because it is hard out there and a lot of young people don’t realize it until it is too late.


What you have to understand is that your mother is only human. You are her child. She wants the best for you and I’m positive she loves you very much.


She could be acting this way because she wants you to learn from your mistake and come home on your own accord. She probably wants you to come home as much as you want to go home.


In Spanish, there is a phrase that says, “Me lavo los manos!” This means, I’m washing my hands. I’m bringing this up because your mom might be “washing her hands” of this situation.


Maybe you have given your mother a lot of problems and heartache over the years. Maybe she feels you have negatively influenced your siblings. She might just feel that when you left, she was going to let you leave the nest and this was the time for her baby bird to sink or fly.


You’ll never know what your mother is thinking unless you talk to her.


Tell her how you feel about everything that has happened, why you ran away, how you felt when you were on the streets, why you want to come home, and what you hope to do to remedy the situation.


Tell her what you want of her and ask what she wants of you.


If you do go back home, there are always going to be rules. No matter where you live, if you are not the lease holder, there will be rules. So if you don’t want to find yourself on the streets again, no matter what, respect your mother and her home. If you don’t go back home, there is plenty of help out there. You just have to look for it.
