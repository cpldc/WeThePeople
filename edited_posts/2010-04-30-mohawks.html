				**Editor’s Note:** The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.


Watch out! It’s a plane! It’s a bird! No … It’s a new haircut?


Mohawks are taking South Shore School of Leadership by storm.


Stefan Robertson, a senior at South Shore School of Leadership, said he wears Mohawks because they are different.

Stefan also said that other people in his family have worn this hairstyle. His whole family rocked this style during the New Year’s celebration last year.


When I asked what he thought about people who don’t like the style he said “most people who talk trash about it end up getting it anyway.”


But Daryl Pinkston, another senior, thinks otherwise. He said people who wear Mohawks look stupid and the only reason guys get the hairstyle is to impress girls.


When I asked Daryl would he ever get the hairstyle, he said he would consider it only if designs were incorporated into the haircut.


First worn by Native American tribes, then punk rockers in the 80’s, this trendy hairstyle has been widely adopted. According to Wikipedia there are various styles of the Mohawk.


Color hawks are worn with all different colors; death hawks are Mohawks worn with the Gothic look; reverse hawks shave a center strip while leaving the sides alone; and there are many more.


It was just the other day when I saw a baby at Wal-Mart with a Mohawk.


They are everywhere and worn by everyone: young and old, boy and girl, black and white.


Usually styles last for a certain time period, it’s a new year and the Mohawk is still going strong as it was last year when Stefan’s family had them.


Will this style ever die?
