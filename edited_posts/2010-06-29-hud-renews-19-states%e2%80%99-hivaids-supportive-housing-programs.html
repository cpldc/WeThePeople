				The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced on June 29 that it will award $30 million dollars to HIV/AIDS housing programs across the nation - to continue support of stable housing for the next three years - to organizations serving more than a thousand extremely low-income individuals and families living with HIV/AIDS who are at risk for homelessness.
The funding is offered through HUD's Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program (HOPWA) and will renew HUD's support of 29 local programs in 19 states.
<!--more-->The AIDS Foundation of Chicago, Reentry Housing for Health Partnership — with the Christian Community Health Center — is awarded a HOPWA permanent supportive housing renewal grant of $1,419,762 “to continue providing scattered-site Tenant-Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) to 38 post-incarcerated individuals annually,” according to HUD’s press release.
The grants also support the Obama Administration's new strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness, which was announced last week at the White House.
