				**Editorâ€™s Note:** The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.
**I ain't a crackhead**


I have way more respect for myself


Than to be out here getting high taking risks with my health


I don't want to be a mental slave to any drug


Squatting in a vacant apartment on a dirty floor covered with bugs


I'll never be walking the streets in search of coke


While I watch my future go up in smoke


I'm way too sophisticated and way too educated


To be overdosing or getting hooked


The only thing I'm overdosing on is the books


I don't have all day to be on security


Because that shows a lack of maturity


I don't have time to sleep standing up


I have bigger plans for when I grow up


I plan on getting the best education and not being misled


Whatever I do, I ain't going to be no crackhead


<!--more-->


**I ain't no killer**


I'd rather save a life


Because murderers don't think twice


Not until they're locked up and never coming home


Convicted in court, now that's two lives gone


Two more Black people gone for no reason


Killers roam the streets with guns like its hunting season


The old people live in fear and little kids can't go out and play


Especially when there's a shootout and they get in the way


This year like others we'll see t-shirts of deceased loved ones


This year like others people will die because someone got beat up and ran to get a gun


When someone gets killed they always say he was at the right place at the wrong time but it seems to me


If someone is shooting at you, no matter what time it is that's the wrong place to be
**I ain't a liar**


I prefer the truth be the only thing that crosses my lips


There's not a dishonest bone in my body from toes to fingertips


Sometimes people lie to spare others' feelings


But to me that's just shady dealings


Is lying really a must?


What happened to the trust?


Parents lie to their children thinking we can't handle the real


They don't take the time out to see how we feel


They say the truth shall set you free, then I'm free as the wind


Rumors, gossip, and snitching are all part of the trend


I try to stay away from falsehoods and deceit


If you didn't hear me the first time, don't worry I'll repeat


I ain't no liar
**I ain't a dropout**


I ain't dropping out because there ain't nothing in the streets


I can be somewhere in class instead of getting in petty beefs


I need to learn anyway


I'm not just living for today


If I want to have a future I need to stay in school


Because we all know there's nothing worse than a grown fool


I realize there's nothing wrong with being book smart and that's the truth


I can look around my hood every day and see the proof


If I don't know something I need to find out


I'm not going to get what I need to succeed sitting in the house on my couch that's why I'm never dropping out
**I ain't no criminal**


Sometimes I sit and dream looking at the stars


Wondering about all of the people spending their lives behind bars


Going back and forth to jail that's too many times


Not even getting anything out of committing all of their crimes


But nowadays everybody wants to be a thug or worse


Sticking up, snatching money until someone gets hurt


When you're grown and can't get a job because of the x's on your back


You'll know that going to jail just pulls your life of track


Committing crime looks fun but then they take it too far


Your mom, kids, or girl will be crying when you're in the back of a that blue and white police car


I see people doing the wrong thing and only getting the bare minimal


Me, I'm staying in school 'cause I ain't no criminal
**I ain't ignorant**


I happen to be very smart


And I know that having an education will take me very far


I go to school and try to do my best


Some days I'm tired as ever without any rest


When I lie in my bed and close my eyes


I'm thinking about what if I had died


Other than that I have no worries


Just a bunch of stories


I've learned a lot of things and there's one I must confess


Education to me is the key to success


Knowing things and people will help you make it in life


But you'll never make it treating your life like a game of dice
**I ain't a drug dealer**


I'm a young black man that thinks a lot about school


I don't sell drugs because selling drugs to blacks is cruel


Drug dealers are wild and don't care


Where will they go? Some don't know where


They will get locked up, kidnapped, or end up dead


I ain't a drug dealer because I've got too much in my head


I ain't a drug dealer because killing ain't right


The drugs they sell really take lives, that's why I stay focused with all my might


Getting money is a lot, but taking lives is more


Killing someone else's family members is like killing one of yours


I don't sell drugs because there are many more ways to hustle for dough


No matter how much money you've got if your selling drugs you're living low


I want to do something with my life that'll make my mother, family and friends proud


So if you didn't hear me at first, I'll say it loud


I ain't no drug dealer
**I ain't a thief**


I'm a young, funny and athletic dude


All around smart and most of the time cool I love to play basketball inside or on the streets


Whatever you want to call me don't call me a thief


I don't take money or watches to tell the time


I don't need to steal, I can earn mine


Money, cars, clothes, and everything flashy


Why steal things when I'm better off asking?


Air Force Ones and Girbauds I don't need to take


Nor Jordans, Rocawear, or Bathing Apes


Anything new that I ain't rocking


They think that I'm gonna steal that's why the store owner is watching


They make sure when I'm walking out they know what I've got


Like I don't now if I don't I didn't pay for something they'll call the cops


I'm an honest guy who's mostly nice


Thinking I'm a thief is the wrong stereotype


I'm not dumb, a dropout or hopeless


I'm really just the opposite in case you didn't notice
**I ain't a bustdown**


I'd rather be compared to a princess


Yes, the best of the best


Nonetheless Relax your nerves and take a rest


I'm not anybody's piece on me you can't put a price


So if you think I'm that nice I'd advise you to think twice


I'm not a street walker


So beat it if you're a sweet talker


It's hard for me to believe


That I cannot succeed


Ask anyone, it's certain


That I am a unique person


I always show my true personality


This is no joke its reality


Check my background


It'll show that I ain't a bustdown
**I ain't a gangbanger**


And today that's alright


I'd much rather play basketball than shoot someone or fight


I don't have to claim a gang and I'll be just fine


At school I'll be carrying my work instead of drugs or a nine


I will fight and strive for As and Bs


Instead of being in the middle of wars between GDs and BDs


I want people to respect me for my education


Not because I beat someone up at the train station


Don't guess I'm in a gang because of my clothes or looks


If the police search my bookbag they'll only find my ankle brace and books


I'd much rather be somewhere hoping or chilling with a little honey


Than standing on the corner with my hat turned trying to make some money


I've learned that the ones that think they're cool turn out to be the biggest fools


That's exactly why I'm staying my butt in school


I know that with good connections and education my life won't have limitations


There won't be a need for rehabilitation or restoration because I have all the basic information.


We're not any of those negative stereotypes, but it's easy for us to become them.


We are the future


Exactly what we become in the future is up to us


Peace.
