Protesters who want to avert cuts to the city’s mental health clinics tried a unique tactic this week.
As the City Council convened their first session since voting to close half of the city's clinics and privatize all of its neighborhood health centers, members of the Mental Health Movement wore Santa Claus hats and formed a circle in the hallway outside the elected officials’ offices at City Hall, then sung altered classic holiday songs. 
In their rendition of “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,” “Jingle Bells,” and the “Twelve Days of Christmas,” they accused Mayor Rahm Emanuel and other city officials of catering to “corporate greed,” and giving “tax breaks” to the wealthy while closing clinics in poor African American and Hispanic communities “without shame.”

The protestors declared that “On the twelfth day of Christmas, the Mayor took away any chance of re-election, NATO protest permits, any hope of learning, public libraries, 8 public schools, 7 health centers, living wage jobs, all our hopes and dreams, mental health clinics, all our meds, our therapists and public health from the city!”

Members of the Mental Health Movement also urged City Council members “to do what’s right this holiday season,” by holding hearings on clinic closures and delaying the closures pending an impact study. They also urged legislators to meet with people who use the mental health facilities to hear their stories.
Stephanie Torres, a member of the group and a college student, told Residents’ Journal after the protest that Emanuel’s decision to privatize and close the mental health clinics would “be very devastating” to their clientele as well “devastating for the community.”

“It’s just ripple effect, the city as a whole,” Torres said. “And we’re just here to protest that privatization and closing is not the answer,” she said.
Some of the members performed a short skit in the hallway, depicting Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel as “The Grinch who stole clinics” instead of Christmas. 
The City Council voted to close six of the Chicago Public Health Department’s 12 mental health clinics, all of which are located in low-income communities of color.
**One Patient’s Plea**


Linda Hatcher, 60, has been a patient for the past 24 years at the mental health clinic targeted for closure in the Woodlawn community. She has suffered a mental breakdown in the past and has been undergoing treatment for “postponed depression and bipolar” health conditions. The Woodlawn clinic is close to her home and on the route of her commute on public transportation, and Hatcher added that she also has a daughter who suffers from bipolar disorder.

“I’m a fighter,” Hatcher said after the protest. “I’m not going to give up that easy. By her having bipolar I help her out with my grandbabies and everything, and we need that clinic open. I’m going to fight, and they’re going to keep it open,” she declared.
Hatcher said she has established a good relationship with her therapist at the Woodlawn Mental Health Clinic, which she didn’t want to be disrupted.
“I talk to my therapist for my to put me right back on the right track cause I do fall off sometimes. But by me taking my medicine…it helps keep me together,” she said.
**Protestors Altered Holiday Carol Lyrics**
**Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer**


Mayor Emanuel’s budget


Wants to make our clinics close


All of the city council


Shrugs and says “that’s how it goes”
All of the Mayor’s buddies


Toast their glasses of champagne


He’s giving them big tax breaks


And closing clinics without shame
Then one cold December night


The people rose to fight


Mayor your budget’s not right


We’ll resist your greed and might!
Then all the people rose up


Fighting against corporate greed


We’re building one big movement


And we’ll go down in history!
**Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas**


Have you just a little bit of heart left?


To respect our rights?


If you close our clinics we will rise and fight
Have you just a little bit of heart left?


Don’t we have a say?


If they close, our clinics will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days


With no rights or say at all.


If mental health isn’t near to us


Through the cracks we’ll fall
Through the years you’ve subsidized your rich friends


Like the CME


You’ve got money for all of your rich buddies


So closing clinics is heartless as we all can see!
**Jingle Bells**


Dashing through the snow


Cause my clinic closed today


Across gang lines I go


Can you hear me say NO NO NO


If our clinics close


Or it you privatize


What will you say to those who know


That we will lose some lives  - HEY!
E-man-uel,


E-man-uel


Can’t fool me today!


Corporate greed gets more and more


While our clinics go away, hey!


(2x)
For well over a year


We’ve tried to get your ear


But every time we’ve tried


You just run and hide (SHAME SHAME SHAME)


So your budget passes


To close clinics and schools


While cut your friends’ taxes


You must think we’re fools - HEY!
E-man-uel,


E-man-uel


Can’t fool me today!


Corporate greed gets more and more


While our clinics go away, hey!


(2x)
**O Christmas Tree**


O can’t you see? O can’t you see?


This Mayor’s budget’s deadly?


O can’t you see? O can’t you see?


He’s closing clinics for you and me


It’s only bankers who he hears,


Mental health clinics disappear.


O Can’t you see, O can’t you see?


We need our clinics to be free!
