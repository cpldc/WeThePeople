				**Editor’s Note:** The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.
Enrolling as a freshman at South Shore School of Leadership, my parents and I got quite worried.
One of the biggest fights I ever witnessed took place in one of my classrooms, with students slinging chairs, being thrown into tables and eventually destroying the entire classroom.
<!--more-->As a result of this horrible act, students and staff were hospitalized. Some students were handcuffed and sent straight to jail. Some had broken legs or busted heads.
Lately, many high school students have been hurt or killed due to teen violence in or around school areas.
It really seems to be a struggle to stay focused in school when constantly worrying about when the next fight will break out, either in class or during passing periods in the halls.
It concerns me that so many things are happening in and around schools. I don’t know whether the next thing that happens will make a friend, or even me, the next victim. The biggest concern in school should be forgetting to do homework or neglecting to study for a test, not a punch in the face or a riot after school.
High school is hard enough without the added worry of getting beat up or killed because of someone else’s issues.
These issues range from emotionally unstable, jealousy, hearsay or being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.
High school students always complain about being treated like little kids, but in my opinion, many are acting like it.
It’s time for many to grow up and quit making school harder than it already is, and then maybe we can finally learn something.
