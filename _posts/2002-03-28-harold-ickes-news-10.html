				<strong></strong>Things have changed dramatically here in Ickes. On one hand, they remain the same. But some things have gotten worse.</p>
<div>The most dramatic change has occurred all along the State Street  Corridor, where public housing has had its imposing presence whittled  down to flatlands of mystery.</p>
<p>Who knows where all the families have gone? Who knows what will occupy  the vacated land? Who knows when and if sufficient housing for  low-income families will rise from the demolition of "a city within a  city?"<!--more--></p>
<p>Another real change coincided with the heating up of the Illinois state  primary election. All of last year, a change seemed possible to the  residents unhappily tolerating the overwhelming, constant onslaught of  strangers. The new lighting systems shone bravely down on the hundreds  of milling males and females who homelessly paced the front, back and  inner catacombs of the public housing systems seeking sweet release.</p>
<p>During the third week of February, when the politicians' faces and  platforms became more constant on television, fewer groups of seekers  struggled down the paths in pain.</p>
<p>Fewer families' faces waited to transact. Suddenly, riding down State  Street as I did daily, there were no more swarms of loiterers claiming  parking spaces, cluttering lobbies, overcrowding elevators and spitting  where they pleased. By the time primary day came, the scenes in front of, inside of, and in  the surrounding places were sterile where they were once so infected.  One can truthfully say the State Street Corridor is clean as a whistle.  At last! Whew!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the battle for safe, decent parking remains the same in  this development for residents of 2310 - 2250- 2240 S. State St. and  other buildings.</p>
<p>We risk our well being just coming from work trying to park in a dry  place, away from deep mud pits, serious pools of water and unfair  parking tickets.</p>
<p>My experience has been to be the only recipient of 2 parking tickets in a  long line of cars parked so close to a fence that no one could even  open the passenger side door.  Many of my neighbors have paid,  contested, and I'm sure ignored a slew of unfair tickets.</p>
<p>I spoke to the new main manager, Mr. Williams, about the problem and he  said, "I'm working on it. We will be taking care of that soon."</p>
<p>I also asked if he could supply me with a letter to explain our  circumstances with the parking so that we wouldn't have to keep paying  for tickets that are given out wrongfully.</p>
<p>He said, "Tell me what you need and I'll get it for you."</p>
<p>Well, that's the last I've heard from management. I would hope this  would be the end of the frustration surrounding the parking here.</p>
<p>However, it's been back to square one. The construction company has  ripped up the pavement from State Street on 23rd Street moving west to  Federal Street. You cannot drive near the building you live in, so you  take your chances on State Street.</p>
<p>There was no warning. They left big holes in the ground where water has  pooled. It's dangerous walking for children and seniors and impossible  for a toddler. There are no barriers, no notices revealing a time for  repairs, nothing.  Disrespected again.</p>
<p>We do expect for the apartments to be renovated. But why do we have to  suffer the depths of disrepair before the dawn of renewal?</p>
<p>Again, if you can believe it, the mailboxes in my building - as in many  others - look horrible. A few of them don't even lock. There is a space  between two banks of boxes six inches wide and 12 inches deep used for  garbage, debris and trash.</p>
<p>The door leading from the front hallway to the back exit is dangerously  hanging on one hinge over the lower one, so the top of the door leans,  lying in wait to fall on some unsuspecting victim. Management seems not  to care. It's been hanging this way for a month.</p>
<p>The bright spot in all this was the day we delivered the latest edition  of RJ. The children, boys and girls, enjoyed the job. They got paid,  learned skills and gained pride in a job well done.</p></div>
