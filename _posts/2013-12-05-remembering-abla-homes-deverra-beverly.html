<p>Deverra Beverly, a Chicago Housing Authority commissioner and long-time president of the resident council at the ABLA Homes public housing development on the West Side, died November 9, 2013.</p>
<p><strong>CHA Officials Honor Statement about Beverly</strong></p>
<p>Beverly was appointed to the CHA Board of Commissioners by former Mayor Richard M. Daley on July 22, 2009.</p>
<p>A life-long public servant, she held numerous resident leadership positions prior to her appointment, including president of ABLA Homes’ Local Advisory Council, vice chair of the Central Advisory Council from 2002 to 2008, interim CAC chair from 2008 to 2009, and treasurer in 2009.</p>
<p>In an email to <strong><em>Residents' Journal</em></strong>, a CHA press statement recalled that Beverly also worked for the City’s Department of Human Services for 30 years and received “countless awards in recognition of her efforts to improve the quality of life in public housing.”</p>

<p>The statement adds, “On behalf of the entire agency, CHA would like to send its sincerest condolences to her family and friends. Commissioner Beverly will be missed.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>National Public Housing Museum </strong></p>
<p>Beverly was also a Founding Chair of the National Public Housing Museum and her “vision gave birth to the [organization],” according to officials there, who made their own public statement on her recent passing.</p>
<p>“We will be forever indebted to her unwavering commitment and forceful dedication to realizing the museum as a place that would recall the civic good of public housing and above all would preserve the lives and the wisdom of public housing residents for perpetuity.</p>
<p>“Her life of leadership of the museum, as the president of ABLA Local Advisory Council and as a CHA commissioner stands as a testament to her firm belief in public housing residents as fundamental actors who have consequential impact on the history of Chicago and the nation,” they added.		</p>
