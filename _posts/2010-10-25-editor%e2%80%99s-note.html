<p>The four articles below <a href="http://iga.edu/help-academic-homework-service/">homework help websites</a> were written by the students in Residents’ Journal’s Urban Youth International Journalism Program.</p>
<p>The youths participated in a city wide youth media project, NUF-SAID. Nuf-Said is a project of the Chicago Youth Voices Network, a collaborative of youth media organizations throughout the Chicagoland area to create media around issues that youths feel are important.</p>
<p>The youths’ articles, along with the other media organizations’ projects, can also be seen at <a href="http://nuf-said.org/">www.nuf-said.org/ </a>.</p>
