<p>
				On April 17, there was a march to stop the violence in Lathrop Homes. The march took off from the Cotter Boys and Girls Club.</p>
<p>In attendance were members of the Cotter Club as well as staff along  with Local Advisory Council members as well as the CHA Service  Connectors, members of the Tenant Patrol and staff of the DePaul  University Urban Systems of Care, members of Chicago Alternative  Policing Strategy and officers of the 19th District.</p>
<p>There could and should have been more residents of the community  involved, especially since a young man was killed in the community a  couple of weeks before the march. There have been reports of gunfire  being heard in the development and the summer hasn't even started yet.  Let's hope this march is the beginning of many such events to help the  residents and, most of all, our children to have a safe and violent-free  summer in all developments, not just Lathrop Homes. Our children  deserve to be in a safe environment.<!--more--></p>
<p>On April 19, the City of Chicago had its Clean Day and Roll Call in  Lathrop Homes. The event brought people out from all over Chicago.  Police officers were there in addition to officials from CHA, the City  Department of Sewers, the Hamlin Park neighbors, the Illinois Department  of Forestry, the Illinois Department of Animal Control, US Dwellings  Management, the Lathrop Local Advisory Council, City Department of  Streets of Sanitation and the CAPS program as well as the new police  commander of the public housing unit and state Senator-nominee Iris  Martinez. Thanks to everyone who came out to this event.</p>
<p>Also, it is that time of year again. Friends of the River and the River  Committee with the help of Joe Vega will have river rescue day along the  river and will also clean along the Jimmy Thomas Nature Trail.</p>
<p>Anyone wanting to help, please contact Earl Battles at the LAC at 312 -791-8740 for more information. All ages are welcome.</p></p>
