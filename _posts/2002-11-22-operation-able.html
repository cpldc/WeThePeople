				<strong></strong><span style="font-size: small;">I</span>'d like to inform the  readers of an organization that states that it helps seniors, people  with disabilities and others find part-time work and training in many  Chicago locations, with some offices a few blocks away from CHA  developments.</p>
<div>Operation ABLE is a non-profit organization that was founded in 1977,  according to their 1998/1999annual report.  "Operation ABLE was created by the Chicago Community Trust Organization  with a staff of three, a budget of $47,500 and a vision of helping  workers 55 years of age and older find employment opportunities."</p>
<p>The group serves seniors, people with disabilities and others by  providing them with employment and training. “Operation ABLE (Ability Based on Long Experience) became known as an  advocate for the older workers. In 1990, Operation ABLE revised its  mission statement to include services to individuals of all ages, while  maintaining its original emphasis on serving the unique needs of the  older worker." <!--more--></p>
<p>There are several programs Operation ABLE has for you to choose from.  Their main concerns are helping individuals find employment and provide  technical training that can help you get the skills needed in today’s  job market. The programs include all age groups and persons with  disabilities.</p>
<p>A flyer from Operation ABLE mentions that on Nov. 1, 2001, the group  held their 11th annual Operation Access job fair with Cook County Board  President John H. Stroger Jr.</p>
<p>“For persons with disabilities, Cook County government is striving for a  barrier-free environment,” the flyer states. I asked Julia Green, program coordinator with Operation ABLE, to  elaborate on her group’s Senior Community Service Employment program.  Green said the program is open to people 55 years or older who have a  low income and live in Chicago. The program is funded by the Illinois  Department on Aging.</p>
<p>"The way that program works is that we provide part-time work of 20  hours a week. (Seniors) are placed to work either here or at other  government agencies or at several of Operation ABLE networking agencies.</p>
<p>“They (the seniors) basically do clerical work. As a matter of fact, all  of our people do clerical work. They do filing, reception and general  office work. A lot of those agencies seek people with computer skills.  We place them with that particular agency. We have an agency who is  looking for someone who can do basic word processing. The pay is $5.15 a  hour, which is minimum wage, because this is a program that’s designed  to give individuals experience so that it will be easier for them to  find them a job that's not funded by the federal government."</p>
<p>Green continued, “Some people in this program have not worked for a long  time. For example, I just had a lady who had not worked in 11 years.  She was enrolled in the program and was placed in a situation where she  is now doing clerical work. She is also getting computer training and  hopefully, in a couple of months, I will be able to move her into a  better paying job.</p>
<p>“While they (the seniors) are in this program, I am the person  responsible for giving them placement assistance and I do that on an  individual basis as well as a group basis. Once a week, I have a job  club meeting in the Pilsen Illinois Employment and Training Center. The  club is just for older workers. They come once a week and they talk  about the interview strategies, resume writing, how to follow up an  interview, how to answer questions that are asked by employers, but  above all, to arrange job interviews and find job openings.</p>
<p>“I show them how to find job openings themselves once they have been on  an interview and come back to the club. We also discuss the results of  the interview and a few basics. How did you handle the interview? Do you  feel you did right or wrong? So, we identify things that they may have  done wrong and correct them so they won’t make the same mistake over and  over again. It's actually a learning experience."</p>
<p>Seniors who find work through the program do not get health insurance or  other benefits. They get paid a half-time rate for vacation and sick  days.</p>
<p>I asked Green if the seniors work because they are bored or just need something to do with their time.</p>
<p>She said, "They work because they have to work to supplement their small income."</p>
<p>Operation ABLE also has a One Stop Employment and Training Center  located at 1657 S. Blue Island, in the vicinity of the Racine Apartments  senior building, the ABLA Homes family development and other sites. The  staff at the One Stop center has a huge list of technical training and  job opportunities anyone can take advantage of. One Stop Center staff  will place people in training programs to help them become vending  machine technicians, telecommunication technicians or electronic service  technicians, according to a brochure given out at the center. The One  Stop Center staff also is supposed to assist people get jobs.</p>
<p>Even though the brochure states the One Stop Center will help people in  this way, I was unable to interview anyone who actually had been served  by them.</p>
<p>The 1998/1999 annual report states, “Other technological advances keep  us competitive and more capable of serving our clients and our  ever-expanding network agencies. The computer network was first  installed at our Pilsen One-Stop with Internet access at all work  stations. The new state-of-the-art computerized tracking system, which  stores client information, is also up and running. All of our sites,  with the exception of the training center, now have Internet access and  the ability to electronically communicate with each other through local  area networks. We have also established direct links to 41 Chicago area  employers, who list job openings on their Web sites."</p>
<p>Operation ABLE also has another program called the ABLA Transitional Job Center, 1209 S. Loomis Ave.</p>
<p>Here are some excerpts taken from an Operation ABLE flyer that has an overview of services at the ABLA Transitional Job Center:</p>
<p>“The ABLA Transitional Job Center (TCJ) works in partnership with the  Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) ABLA Homes to implement a HUD  revitalization grant known as Hope VI. The goal of HOPE VI is to change  the face of public housing developments and create viable, safe,  mixed-income communities inhabited by a combination of residents needing  affordable housing. These residences would ideally be part of the  neighborhood fabric of the city, as opposed to being isolated pockets of  blighted housing, high crime, and poverty.</p>
<p>“The ABLA residents, represented by the Local Advisory Council, the City  of Chicago, Operation ABLE Inc. and the CHA, developed a plan to  establish this site at ABLA where residents could receive job readiness  skills, social services, vocational training and job placement.</p>
<p>“The TJC was opened on July 26, 1999, with a staff of seven case  managers, job developers and trainers providing a multitude of service  and service referrals. Since then, more than 1,000 residents have come  through the facility….” The brochure states that the Transitional Job Center specializes in  working with men who are ex-offenders, chronically unemployed or  otherwise hard to place in jobs.</p>
<p>“So far, we have been able to place twenty –three (23) of fifty-eight  (58) of them and forty-five (45) of fifty-five (55) have been enrolled  in vocational training.</p>
<p>This population is extremely critical in fulfilling the vision of Hope  VI to create self-sufficiency and full employment to the residents of  the "NEW" ABLA Homes - a mixed-income community of working families."</p>
<p>I made an exhaustive effort to get more information about the ABLA  Transitional Job Center but to no avail. I made a telephone call to  Charles Wood, the director of center. At the time, he said he was too  busy to comment on the program and then didn't return my telephone call,  as he promised.</p></div>
