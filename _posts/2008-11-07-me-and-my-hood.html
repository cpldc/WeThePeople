				<strong>Editorâ€™s Note:</strong> The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.</p><!--more-->
<p>When the first day came that I had a chance to see the sun<br />
My mom and dad were happy that my life had begun<br />
When I was a shorty I used to get on my mom's nerves<br />
I used to like watching old folks sit on the porch and throw bread to the birds<br />
In the summer I would leave the house as soon as I awoke<br />
Listening to all the kids say, "It's time to go to chokes"<br />
At night time the Wells is what's happening<br />
If somebody says something wrong we about to get it cracking<br />
Playing ball and going to parties is all I used to do<br />
Nowadays people say that the Wells is through<br />
Wherever we move it won't be as good<br />
As the days gone by and me and my hood		</p>
