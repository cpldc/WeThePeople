<strong>CA</strong>: What were your goals as a high school student?<br />
<strong>RM</strong>: Had none, not to get jumped, to work, and not to get any one pregnant. It was not till my senior year in high school that I thought about college then my goal was to better myself. I did not think it was fair or right that most people of color struggle so much including my family.  In college, freshman year was just to survive. The first year was the most difficult year of my life. I felt out of place, I felt stupid, I did not have the skills to do well, I did not belong. Every moment was so much work. My only goal was to not quit or drop out.  After that my goal was to graduate and be successful in college.<br />
<strong>CA</strong>: How did you reach those goals?<br />
<strong>RM</strong>: Hard work, determination, sacrifice, tears, help from others and help from God.</p>
<p><strong>CA</strong>: What obstacles did you have to overcome to reach your goals?<br />
<strong>RM</strong>: Tons of obstacles, mostly people assuming a lot of stuff because I was Latino, tons of obstacles at home. It was hard for my mom to be supportive. Tons of money obstacles, at times I did not have money to do laundry. The obstacle of having to work ten times harder on schoolwork because the public school did not prepare me.</p>
<p><strong>CA</strong>: What are some important lessons you learned as a student?<br />
<strong>RM</strong>: Perseverance - never give up -  to help my family by accomplishing my goals and to help my community<br />
</p>
<p><strong>CA</strong>: Do you have any helpful tips for the Little Village students?<br />
<strong>RM</strong>: Yes, think about the big picture, don’t just think about today and today’s problems, issues or drama, think about ten years from now, where you want to be, how you want to help and change things for others, believe in yourself, remember SOJO who will always believe in you.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>CA</strong>: What is the most difficult part of being a principal?<br />

</p>
<p><strong>CA</strong>: What is the most fulfilling part of it?<br />
<strong>RM</strong>: Seeing a dream become true.<br />
