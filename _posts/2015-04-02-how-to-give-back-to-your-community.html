				<strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> <em>The following story was written by a student in our Urban Youth International Journalism Program. The UYIJP is generously funded by the <a href="http://www.mccormickfoundation.org/">McCormick Foundation</a>.</em></p>
<p>People can give back to their community by seeing what is needed in that particular place. They can find a way to help fulfill the need of that particular community by getting personally involved. Say, for instance, the community needs a new basketball court; the people living there could hold a fundraiser selling items they know others will buy. It doesn't have to necessarily be junk food (chips and Candy), but they can sell healthier alternatives (vegetables, fruits and nuts).  They can even sell home made items (thank you cards, jewelry or clothes) at a reasonable price. These are things people like and will purchase, thereby raising the money for the court.</p>

<p>Another thing that can be done is getting businesses and other individuals to mentor the kids of the community; that can help the kids to better themselves. Having a mentor will give them positive things to do in their free time after their school work is done. We know in some cases school is hard, so creating an opportunity that will motivate the kids to do their school work is essential.</p>
<p>Holding community events for the youth is another way to give back to the community. Having a youth group form to help the whole community get closer and talk about problems that they can work on fixing is another very good way to help. Also including information to remind them that violence is not the answer to conflicts they may have with someone. Lastly, we could start a fund that will expand Black-owned businesses and teach the importance of keeping money in the community.</p>
<p>I attend different events from seminars to community service events and I always promote positive growth. Everything I’ve learned, I’ve told my peers so they can be aware of programs and activities happening in our community. Just to name a few of the things I’ve done to give back to my community, I’ve participated in Kwanzaa celebrations, Safe Summer picnics, and health fairs held in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King. Giving back to the community does make a difference in the lives of those who are helping as well as those who are being helped.		</p>
