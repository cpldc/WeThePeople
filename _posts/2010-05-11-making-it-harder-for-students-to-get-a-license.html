				The Drivers Ed program is making a change in the year 2008 for teens to get their licenses. Rumor has it that the age will move up to 20 to obtain a driver's license.</p>
<p>It's said that the law will be boosting the age up from 18 due to young people's high rate of driving fatalities from ages 16-17.</p>
<p>These changes will also make it harder for students to get their licenses.</p>
<p><!--more-->"It will affect some graduates who are 18 years old and needing their license after graduating from high school," said Mr. Thomas, Collins High School P.E. teacher.</p>
<p>The CPS Drivers Ed program for high school students has 3 phases. All students must pass Phase 1 in order to graduate from high school. It consists of 30 hours of classroom instruction and students must pass the Drivers Ed written exam.</p>
<p>Next, students pay $20 and must complete 8 hrs of simulation training and will then receive their drivers permit.</p>
<p>Last but not least, students must go through the process of range and trafficking where students must drive a car in traffic at least 6 times and then go to the DMV to take the final test.</p>
<p>"The situation is making it harder for students who need transportation. Now that I'm 18, I have a car, and won't be able to drive it because of the age range boosting up." says Carolyn Cain, a senior at Collins high school.</p>
<p>I think this situation is unfair and will affect me in my senior year in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>As a senior, I still haven't gotten my license yet due to the simple fact that I haven't taken simulation training classes or range trafficking.</p>
<p>This will be a hard situation for me to deal with my senior year, along with the many senior activities of luncheon, prom, and graduation fees, and studying my senior coursework. ï»¿		</p>
