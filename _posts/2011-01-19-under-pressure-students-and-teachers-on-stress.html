				<strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: <em>The following story was written by a  student in the Urban Youth International Journalism Program</em>:</p>
<p>Hey, have you ever thought life would be easy? Well it’s not. Even for young people, there is a lot of stress and pressure put on our shoulders.</p>
<p>As a student, it becomes hard to learn and focus because of all the things that occur in a classroom: fighting, loud talking, people talking to friends or even getting smart with the teacher. Add all these things up and they can really throw you off task.</p>
<p><!--more-->Students and teachers at Austin Business Entrepreneurship Academy (ABEA) said they deal with stress and pressure in their daily lives but they also don’t let it get them down.</p>
<p>ABEA student Alexzondria Tiner said there are a lot of stress-inducing negative things that students deal with, but she would like to read about the positive things as well.</p>
<p>“Being a student here is great but there are a lot of stresses that accrue throughout the year, especially around prom time and finals,” she said. “It’s hard to keep track of all those things.”</p>
<p>"Teaching is not stressful. It’s a lot of fun and the kids I work with are great,” said Luther Bennett, who has been teaching at ABEA for a year. “I have worked at other schools and they don't compare to ABEA.”</p>
<p>Bennett has taught at private day schools and elementary schools. Even though they might seem less stressful than a high school, he likes teaching at the high school the best.</p>
<p>Marcus Floyd, a math teacher at ABEA for one year, said he has a busy life going to school and teaching, but “I truly believe God would not put more on me than my shoulders can bear.</p>
<p>“I have learned over life that stress is all internal,” he added. “There is pressure with meeting deadlines and dates. But that is my thing, meaning I have to do a better job with time management.”		</p>
