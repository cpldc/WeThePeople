				Greetings, salutations and peace.</p>
<p>By now, if you have read Dear Resident often, you are somewhat familiar  with my writing style, form and intent. As I have written many times, I  believe that everything has to do with everything and everybody has to  do with everybody, which I hope is reflected in my writing. I usually  start Dear Resident with one subject, incorporating more as I go along,  tying them all together, leading to a central theme. I am, however,  after much thought, dumbfounded as how to start this edition of Dear  Resident. The only thing that comes to mind is the song lyric, “It’s a  thin line between love and hate.” The way I see it, that thin line must  be ABUSE. And unless you are on the far right (love) or far left (hate),  you have been an ABUSER.<!--more--></p>
<p>If you are on the far right (love), you would never think of doing  anything, intentionally or unintentionally, in word or deed to cause  dismay or injury to someone that you really love or care for deeply. If  you are on the far left (hate), you would never think of getting close  enough to what you hate, under any circumstance, not even to cause  dismay or injury. How often you have been the abuser depends on how  close to or far away from  you have been from that thin line. Those of  us close to that line cross it many times back and forth, love to hate,  hate to love, day in and day out not realizing what we are doing to  ourselves, our family, community and society at large.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one’s actions must be extremely wrong, loud or brutal to  be considered abuse. But it is most often the subtle (not easily  detected), hopefully unintentional daily ABUSE (lack of concern and  consideration for others), that goes undetected or ignored, that  undermines relationships and families, husbands and wives, destroying  the self esteem of men, women and children, young and old. There are  many different kinds of ABUSE, but only one type - hurtful, causing harm  or damage in some way. And unless you have had an extraordinary life,  you have been ABUSED. Webster’s Dictionary defines ABUSE as to misuse  (use wrongly), to mistreat (to hurt by treating badly), to use  insulting, coarse or bad language about or to and a bad, unjust or  corrupt custom or practice. The most common form of abuse, Domestic  Violence, has been defined as a set of ABUSIVE behaviors which can  include physical, emotional, sexual, psychological (mental) and economic  abuse. It further states that it is critical to understand that  domestic violence includes a pattern of power and control that one  person or people (the perpetrator) exercises over another (the victim)  that physically harms, induces fear or prevents or forces the victim to  act in a manner that he or she does not which to act.</p>
<p>If you define the term domestic (having to do with home or family or  one’s own country) the definition of domestic abuse can victimize one  person or entire groups, like homosexuals, and races of peoples, like  Blacks or Jews.  Mankind’s abuse extends beyond itself to everything within its  environment and is as old as the Bible account of Cain and Abel and as  young as a toddler verbally or physically abused by an adult.</p>
<p>It reaches from the bottom of Corporate America where workers are paid  minimum wage, not enough to live, to the top, where CEOs are paid  millions, more money that they need to live multiple life times.</p>
<p>It encompasses workers in every corner of the globe, paid slave wages,  while stock market prices soar as the result of their labor.</p>
<p>Abuse is also self-inflicted, by excessive use of drugs and alcohol.  It  is nurtured, under the guise of being an unbreakable habit, by smokers,  gamblers and others who indulge in vices to the point of injury to  themselves and those around them.</p>
<p>Abuse, like most social ills, does not discriminate.  It is present in  every race and culture and on every socio-economic level, which poses  the question, "Is abuse a part of who we are or part of what we do?"</p>
<p>Abuse can be a self-fulfilling, self-perpetuating evil based on ones culture, community and family history.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, patterns of abuse are not easily broken.  To change  abusive behaviors, it is often necessary to change one's entire life.</p>
<p>I truly believe that everything should start with the individual  desiring or in need of change.  We should always examine ourselves first  and make changes before we ask the same of others.  How close to that  thin line are you? ABUSE - Don't take it.  Don't give it.  Don't be it.</p>
<p>Sincerely,  Pat</p></p>
