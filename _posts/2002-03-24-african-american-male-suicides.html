				There is a crisis in America and while African  American leaders search for answers, some community groups are finding  solutions of their own.</p>
<p>A recent study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention and co-authored by University of Pennsylvania Professor Sean  Joe found that suicides remain very high among the nation's youth,  specifically in African American communities, where there is a  significant amount of violence associated with suicides.</p>
<p>"Seventy percent of African American youth who commit suicide do so with  guns," said Joe. The study co-authored by Joe "suggests that there is  in fact a youth development crisis in the African American community." <!--more--></p>
<p>The study concluded the age range for the suicides was 15-19.</p>
<p>Dr. Hugh Butts, a leading African American psychiatrist, agreed that the  use of firearms sends a lethal message but added, "The added stress  alone is crucial to the mental development as an African American teen  in that age bracket. "The Black adolescent is even more vulnerable than adolescents of other  ethnic groups because, not only must they deal with issues confronting  other adolescents, such as personality consolidation, peer pressure, the  stress of dealing with adults, but they must deal with the cultural  aspects of a society which imposes a great deal of stress on them."</p>
<p>Severe problems in urban areas are cause for concern for leaders and  scholars speaking out in African American communities nationwide. Some  alarming figures show that many problems exist among all ethnic groups.  In 1998, white males accounted for 61 percent of all suicides among  youths 10-19, and white males and white females together accounted for  over 84 percent of all youth suicides, according to the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention. The suicide rate has been increasing  most rapidly, however, among African American young men ages 10 to 19 -  more than doubling from 1981 to 1998. Among Hispanic students, young  women were almost three times more likely than young men to have  reported a suicide attempt.</p>
<p>"The most likely explanation for ethnic rate differences is variations  in cultural factors that promote or inhibit suicide," states the Center  for Disease Control and Prevention Web site.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions </strong><br />
In one African American community on the South Side of Chicago, a group  of Christian men are working with African American teen-agers to expand  their knowledge of educational, political and economic issues.</p>
<p>"If they do have fathers, they see us as uncles, or as part and parcel  of the family structure," said George Glenn, director of programming for  Concerned Christian Men Inc.</p>
<p>"The reality of the situation is that most of the young men that we work  with have no viable fathers in the home. It's an outrageous situation.  In their elementary schools and high schools, there are no real male  role models. It's really a female dominated society that these young men  are trying to reach manhood in. We just saw that as being problematic.  So what we did is, we made a commitment that we'll step in and provide  leadership and direction as much as we can,"  As Glenn sees the situation, what is needed to resolve many of the  problems some young people experience on a daily basis are perception,  commitment and a consolidation of forces on many different fronts.</p>
<p>"What we've done is we've made a commitment that we will provide these young men with opportunities to grow," said Glenn.</p>
<p>Glenn seemed to have very definite ideas about many of the issues  needing immediate attention. He doesn't hold just one part of society  responsible. Rather, there is lot everybody could do to make these  problems better.</p>
<p>"We need to get control over various forms of the media to reflect what  is our accurate assessment of reality," Glenn continued. "If you don't  have that man in the family, you have basically a dysfunctional family  because the roles have changed. Mom is the one who can share dreams with  the children. She's there rearing them and she's got a real connection  with them. Now because mothers are either working all the time or taking  on the father role and the mother role, they spend less time sharing in  the children's dreams.</p>
<p>"As a result, not getting that nurturing from a parent allows these kids  to spin off on their own. This allows for gang members to take on a  more family role in the lives of these children. You're having children  rearing children, the blind leading the blind. What it has done is it's  castrated an entire segment of men who are roaming the streets," said  Glenn.</p>
<p>Glenn was critical of hard-nosed conservatives and their theories that people should pull themselves up by their boot-straps.</p>
<p>Though many conservatives consider it coddling to suggest that  self-esteem or the lack thereof is a barrier to productivity, Glenn  said, "Most of the European immigrants didn't face the situation where  there was institutionalized racism. We know that there's institutional  racism. We can see that in corporations. It's designed to keep them  (minorities) as a sub-culture and if it kills the dreams you have, then  that is a wipe out.</p>
<p>"I think that's why so many of us turn to drugs, because we have no more  dreams. It's a very sad situation but I think given the kind of racism  African Americans experience, if they (the powers that be) didn't have  the scapegoat of the Africans in this country, it would've been someone  else. We believe our young men are in crisis right now and we're  stepping up to make that commitment to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>"How do people develop values? It's through the media primarily. Even  word of mouth is not that effective because you can't talk to that many  people.</p>
<p>"We believe our young men are in crisis right now and we're stepping up to make that commitment to bridge the gap," said Glenn.</p>
<p>Glenn's group, Concerned Christian Men Inc., hosts a Man-Boy Breakfast  every third Saturday of the month. At this breakfast, young grammar  school age boys are asked to meet with the Christian men's group to  enjoy a lecture, Bible classes, food and sports in a casual atmosphere.</p>
<p>"The good thing about this breakfast concept is that we have all ages,  literally from 6 to 90 years old represented. It's a way for young men  to view the future, being with us. I think every speaker has such impact  on them because they see the same thing. They see a young man out there  who will one day be an attorney or a sportscaster. We need to get  control over various forms of the media to reflect what is our accurate  assessment of reality."</p>
<p><strong>Violence Prevention Study </strong><br />
A study conducted at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Chicago has shown that young  victims of violence can change their high-risk behaviors. That's the  encouraging news in the final report of "Within Our Reach," a two-year  collaborative study between Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago and the Boys  and Girls Clubs of Chicago. Dr. Leslie Zun, chairman of Mount Sinai's  emergency medicine department, said, "Within Our Reach" developed "when  our staff started seeing young victims of street violence on repeat  visits. It was frustrating to just provide medical treatment and then  send kids back on the street - with a recidivism rate of more than 35  percent. When kids have just been shot or stabbed, they're scared about  the path of violence they've chosen. So we decided to strike when the  glamour of gangs and street violence didn't seem so glamorous after all.   "This is a totally new approach to violence prevention," he added.  "But it seems to have great potential for reaching an extremely  unreachable population who are very mobile, are rarely in school and  have no primary care doctor."</p>
<p>"Within Our Reach" was developed by Zun and Jodi Rosen, a consultant to  the Boys and Girls Clubs. They worked with some 188 youths ages 10-24  who came to Mount Sinai's emergency department with violent injuries,  mainly gunshot and stab wounds. After being randomly divided between a  treatment and a control group, case managers addressed specific needs of  the treatment for six months. They focused on addressing, personal and  family issues, helping establish a formal treatment plan, and making  referrals to services at Mount Sinai, the Boys and Girls Clubs and other  community-based providers. Those in the control group were given a list  of services they could access on their own. It is significant that the  treatment group reported fewer re-injuries than the control group.</p>
<p>"However," said Dr. Zun, "the study found no difference between the two  groups for other targeted behaviors such as arrests and incarceration."</p>
<p>The study also showed that youth in the treatment group were much more  likely to use health and social services than those in the control  group. Some of the services most frequently used were education, job  readiness, legal assistance, child care, substance abuse treatment,  health care and social support. During the two years of the study, 48  participants were enrolled in job training-readiness classes, and 60  participants were linked to medical and health-related services.</p>
<p>What the study made clear was the effect, importance and significance of  the right type of intervention. The study found that for those who want  to provide health care or social services to victims of violence, there  also should be an additional focus on education, employment, gang  intervention and mental health assistance. The study also determined  there was a very high cost to making a significant impact on the  behavior of this high-risk population. The high cost came from using  resources such as transportation, community-based centers, additional  case managers and incentives.   Zun said "Within Our Reach" has become a resource as groups throughout  the country planning similar violence-prevention programs incorporate  these findings into their own plans. Substantial, previously unknown  information about the characteristics of these youths, including  schooling, gang involvement, friends and family, alcohol and drug use,  violence exposure, delinquency patterns and weapon accessibility are now  known.</p>
<p>Zun said the "Within Our Reach" study's results show how intervention  can dramatically lower re-injury rates and ultimately prevent more  violence among difficult-to-reach youths. He acknowledged, "Many of the  targeted behaviors didn't change appreciably, due to a number of factors  including the limited duration of case management, overburdened case  managers, lack of community-based centers to provide services to this  population, and limitations of the referrals," said Zun.</p></p>
