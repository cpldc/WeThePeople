<p> Dear Friends:</p>
<p>We want to thank all of our readers and supporters for participating in our recent Resident Survey. The results have been overwhelming: We received more than 500 responses, an unprecedented level of enthusiasm, and are rapidl
<p>y entering all of the information into our handy database. In coming weeks, we will be releasing what we’ve learned about the opinions, thoughts and aspirations of Chicago’s public housing families, so stay tuned to this web site.</p>
<p>Also in the next few weeks, we will be making the random drawing for our two prizes and informing the winners. We’ve received some questions about the process for the drawing and we want to explain that it will be a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">completely random drawing</span></strong> conducted solely by We The People Media’s executive staff.</p>
<p>Thank you once again for your participation, and for your patience. Please do not hesitate to call or write to me directly if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
