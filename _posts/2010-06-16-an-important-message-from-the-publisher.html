				Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I am thrilled to invite you to the official debut of our  newly improved web site at www.wethepeoplemedia.org.</p>
<p>We have updated the whole  site to allow you to comment on our articles, videos and news coverage.</p><!--more-->
<p>The site  now contains information about our staff as well as a full menu of press clips  about our work, a sizeable archive of print editions of Residents’ Journal, and  a host of other features.</p>
<p>Be sure to sign up for an RSS feed so you can get the  latest updates.</p>
<p>If you are charitably minded, please click the “Support” tab and  check out our new e-commerce service to make a donation.</p>
<p>Remember that We The  People Media/Residents’ Journal is a registered 501 c3 not-for-profit  organization and all donations are tax-deductible.</p>
<p>Any size donation is  appreciated, but $100 or more will be especially helpful to our work empowering  Chicago’s low-income communities with control over their own media  outlets.</p>
<p>I look forward to having you as a member of our on-line  community. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions, comments or  concerns.</p>
