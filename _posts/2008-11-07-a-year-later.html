				<strong>Editorâ€™s Note:</strong> The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.</p>
<p>The Wells would be gone for good. No more late night parties in the Zone, especially no more dog fights. In less than a year the Wells won't be the same. There'll be cocktail parties and backyard barbeques, but you won't hear any loud music. All we'll have left of the Wells is t-shirts, bricks, pictures and stories. No more sitting on the Hill or on the block. No more selling nachos and candy out of your house. There will be Jazz on the Boulevard, Oakwood Shores and many more. In a blink of the eye our childhood memories and landmarks will be demolished.<br />

I don't think that violence will be a major problem in the new neighborhood. The police won't ride up on the sidewalk and try to arrest anyone because in Oakwood Shores you aren't allowed to just hang out in front of the buildings and on corners. There are plenty of good things about Oakwood Shores, but in some peoples' perspective, they say a year later everything will be the same. There will be people coming from the Wells who will move into Oakwood Shores and try to mess things up but I don't think that will happen because there are people already living there from the Wells. I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of Oakwood Shores even though I'm already a resident. In my opinion, they could have done much better on the construction. I also believe that the rules and regulations are a bit strict. Because I live with my mother, I had to learn that sometimes life isn't fair. I know wherever I end up the Wells will always be in my heart.		</p>
