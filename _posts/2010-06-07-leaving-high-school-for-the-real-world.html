				<strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.</p>
<p>Several students in South Shore School of Leadership High School say “school sucks.”</p>
<p>“School is boring, because it’s nothing to do,” said senior Brittney Walter.</p>
<p>Students cannot wait to get out of high school. Senior year is when students get their plans together for after high school.</p>
<p><!--more-->Plans can change, as some of the school’s teachers know from their own experience. Germaine Evanko’s and Eric Harken’s plans both changed.</p>
<p>Evanko planned to go to Ohio State University (OSU) to study art and Spanish, but she went to OSU and studied Spanish and business.</p>
<p>Harken planned to go to college and begin studying for something that would help him get a job.</p>
<p>“I went to college, changed majors twice and flunked out after my freshman year,” he said.  "Took up three more majors, went to three more schools and 6.5 years to graduate.”</p>
<p>Most students cannot wait to get out of their parents’ house, but most teenagers will need their parents in the long run.</p>
<p>Evanko said her father “was extremely supportive.”</p>
<p>Evanko had more than just her father; she had her brother too because he already attended OSU. She was “excited to be out of my home, on my own and off to college.”</p>
<p>Harken was on his own, no one telling him what to do.He was not scared to be all by himself, he was just “clueless.”</p>
<p>“Obviously I made the ‘grown’ decisions,” he said.</p>
<p>Brittney thinks it’s a good idea to explore the world. But she is scared because it is a big responsibility. It is just too much for little old her.</p>
<p>Senior Destiny Coe said she has big dreams for herself and that she has to start taking on responsibility. She has to do what she has to do.</p>
<p>Harken said, “It just gets more difficult from now on, but three times as fun.”</p>
<p>Evanko’s advice is “to not give up on your dreams, work hard, study hard, be a good person and good things will come your way.”		</p>
