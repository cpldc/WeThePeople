<p>Hello Everyone,<br />
My name is Myra King. I am the Local Advisory Council (LAC) President of Trumbull Park and Lowden Homes. I am also the Chairperson of the Central Advisory Council (CAC), as well as a Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) Resident Commissioner.<br />
I send you this message to ensue that you are aware of the following:<br />
People who live in Scattered Sites, public housing, mixed income and those in the Section 8 Program or Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program all have our rents subsidized or with payments by the federal government. We are all tenants receiving help with our rent by the government.<br />
<!--more-->Every second Wednesday of every month at different locations (this month, March, it will be held at the Northeast Scattered Sites, also known as NESS) there is a meeting held for us to voice issues, complaints and concerns we face. CHA and staff are always present at the Tenant Service Meetings.<br />
I remind you that you should always speak to the leadership of your area first and if you feel or want to take your concern to another level, then bring your concern as well as copies of any documents you have to the CAC. If you donâ€™t have leadership, come to the Tenant Service Meeting. I will provide you with the 2012 Tenant Services meeting schedule for your knowledge and review.<br />
If you are interested in becoming a part of the leadership, the Local Advisory Council elections are to be held this summer. In my next post, I will briefly talk about what a Resident Council is, what the responsibilities of the Resident Councils are, and also what a Resident Council does.<br />
I will see you at the meeting,		</p>
