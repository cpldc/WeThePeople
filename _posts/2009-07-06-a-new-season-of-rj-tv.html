				We are thrilled to announce the new season of “RJ TV,” our live, call-in program over the CAN TV network. “RJ TV” focuses on issues of concern to low-income youths and families, and provides viewers throughout Chicagoland with the chance to share their perspectives. The new season begins Monday, July 6, at 6:30 p.m. over cable channel 21, and will run for 12 weeks at the same time. A longtime partner of We The People Media’s, CAN TV provides non-profit organizations, elected officials and others with incredible opportunities to broadcast to millions of viewers.<br /><!--more-->
