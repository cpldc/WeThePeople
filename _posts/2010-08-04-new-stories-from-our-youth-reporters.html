				New stories from students in our Urban Youth International Journalism Program are now available for your viewing.<!--more-->
<p>These articles were written by young people from the Altgeld Gardens Chicago public housing community through our partnership with People for Community Recovery, an environmental justice group that focuses on fighting for environmental and economic equity on the Southeast Side of Chicago and beyond.</p>
<p>Please click <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/youth/archive/">here </a>to read the youthsâ€™ articles on where they live, what is needed in their community, a personal experience with a drama club, a perspective on bullying, a protest on the lack of a library at the public housing site, and an interview with a community dentist.		</p>
