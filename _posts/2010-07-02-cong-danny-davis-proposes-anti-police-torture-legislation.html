				Even as he declared in a statement that “The Jon Burge trial has ended with a verdict of guilty to the charge of perjury and obstruction of justice, which to me and countless others is simply not enough,” U.S. Cong. Danny Davis (D-IL) has submitted proposed legislation that would eliminate the statute of limitations for the crime of torture.</p><!--more-->
<p>He describes the legislation as “designed to provide a criminal penalty for torture committed by law enforcement officers and others acting under color of law.”</p>
<p>You can read his full statement on the introduction of his Anti-Torture Bill at:  <a href="http://davis.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=192&amp;Itemid=56">http://davis.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=192&amp;Itemid=56</a></p>
<p>Davis is a board member of We The People Media.		</p>
