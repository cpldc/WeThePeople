				The Chicago Housing Authority reported on November 18, 2008 that  "contrary to claims made that increased violence can be tied to former  CHA leaseholders."  They determined that no link between the Plan for  Transformation's demolition of high-rise public housing buildings and  perceived increases in crime can be made.</p>
<p>Based on an analysis of Chicago Police Department data, CHA CEO Lewis A.  Jordan provided a snapshot of how it tenants, and the City of Chicago,  are faring since the start of their 1.6 billion housing revitalization  plan, at the CHA Board of Commissioners meeting earlier in the day at  the LeClaire Courts public housing complex.</p>

<p>Jordan stated at the meeting that his report proves "false public  assertions that neighborhoods are being overrun by CHA relocatees whom  use their Housing Choice Vouchers."</p>
<p>In fact, he said, "the percentage of units occupied by CHA relocatees in  a neighborhood does not exceed 3%, while most see only a fraction of a  percentage."</p>
<p>According to the CHA's analysis, 8,000 former leaseholders have moved to  housing of their own choice, temporary or permanent, over the past  several years in 70 of Chicago's 77 neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The CPD data according to Jordan, also explains that "of the 70  communities in which CHA residents have relocated, only six have seen  crime increase and these appear to have no correlation to the number of  former CHA residents living there."</p>
<p>"CHA relocates represent less than 1 % of the households, in the nine  communities where crime increased between the 2001 and 2007," he said.</p>
<p>He added that the West Englewood area shows "an absolute decrease in  crime of 118 incidents and a reduction of the murder rate from 18 to 14.  Greater Grand Crossing saw a reduction of crime by 720 occurrences.  Roseland saw a reduction in crime of 285 incidents and a decrease in  murders from 26 to 17."</p>
<p>Jordan also stated that "South Shore and Englewood are two prime  examples of neighborhoods where residents are under the impression that  crime has increased since CHA's Plan for Transformation," in which only  1% and 1.5% of the units respectively are occupied by relocatees.</p>
<p>Jordan also reported that according to their analysis of the CPD data,  "crime in both of those neighborhoods actually declined."</p>
<p>"Englewood saw their crime rate decline 11% while South Shore saw its  rate decline 18% between 2001 and 2007.  The numbers speak for  themselves," he said.</p>
<p>Jordan stressed to the Board that the snapshot presented at the Tuesday  meeting, was only a beginning of their assessment of the relocation  process.</p>
<p>"As we move forward with the Plan for Transformation, the integration of  residents into new neighborhoods, and any necessary community  transition following will continue to be our top priority.  The data  presented here, although extremely comprehensive and supportive of the  Plan, is only a start.  We will continue to question and assess our  relocation processes as necessary until the end," he said.		</p>
