<p>
				There have been a lot of  complaints from public housing residents recently about the leadership  in their developments. Some residents feel they are not being properly  represented by their elected representatives. Others feel that there is  always favoritism in the distribution of donated items, jobs and other  things. Some residents also feel monies are being mismanaged. <!--more--></p>
<p>I don’t want to be biased as I am a member of the Lathrop Homes Local  Advisory Council and have a good relationship with most of the LAC  presidents. Yet, I want to be fair to all in this article. So I have  chosen to speak with residents about these complaints but also hear the  resident leadership’s side. And let’s hope, for the sake of both sides  and the benefit of all residents, that these problems can be worked out  and everyone can work together for the good of the residents during this  time of transformation. Remember that we are going to find good as well  as bad in most organizations.</p>
<p>Here are some of the complaints that residents had:</p>
<p>The complaint I was given most was that the same people are always  picked for jobs and given the various things that CHA has to give to the  residents.</p>
<p>To this complaint, one LAC president said that in most cases, the  residents who benefit from these items are the people who volunteer and  in most cases attend meetings. This president said that it makes sense  to look out for them first.  One resident came to tenant services and complained that she served on  the advisory council but did not know when the LAC meeting was or was  never informed of the meeting and never received flyers to any of the  events in the area.</p>
<p>I spoke with this LAC president and was told this person always is  informed of the meetings because all board members receive a phone call  and in addition receive a flyer or letter. This resident was even given a  Christmas present brought by the president but never even showed to  pick that up, according to the president. She added that she believes  that the attacks from this resident are because she also ran for LAC  president and lost.</p>
<p>Then there are a few residents who get help from the LAC landing a job  but then fail a drug test and get mad with the LAC. This is for sure not  the fault of the LAC.</p>
<p>In the development in which I serve, I try to work for the good of all  residents. But of course, you can’t satisfy everyone.  And let’s just  hope that there can be a better working relationship with all LAC and  residents.</p>
