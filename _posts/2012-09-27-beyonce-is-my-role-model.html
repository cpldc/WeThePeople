				<strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> <em>The following story was written by a student in the Urban Youth International Journalism Program in partnership with Luke O'Toole Elementary School in Chicago’s Bronzeville neighborhood.</em></p>
<p>Beyonce Knowles is my role model because she’s independent. I believe that she has worked hard for her own success. Beyonce is known as a singer and actress, and she also has a very popular clothing line, Derrion. One day, I believe I can be just like her and become an actress or own my own clothing line.</p>
<p>Beyonce Giselle Knowles-Carter was born September 4, 1981, in Houston, Texas. She’s an American singer, song writer, producer and actress. Beyonce started off in a best selling girl group, Destiny’s Child. In 2003, Beyonce went solo and debuted her album “Dangerously In Love.” In 2005, the group Desrtiny’s Child broke up. Beyonce then released her second solo album, “B’Day,” in 2006. Beyonce has released 4 albums, the last two are “I AM Sasha Fierce,” released in 2008, and the fourth one, “4,” released in 2011.</p>
<p>Beyonce won 32 awards from 1997-2011, 16 Billboard Awards, 13 MTV Awards and 3 awards with Destiny’s Child. She starred in 6 movies: “Listing Carmen: A Hip Hop Opera” in 2001, “Austin Powers in Goldmember” in 2006, “Cadillac Records” in 2008, and “Obsessed” in 2009. Beyonce is a very good actress.</p>
<p>I interviewed 2 Beyonce fans, Misty Greene and Dania Lester, and this is what they had to say:<br />
<!--more-->Me: Why do you like Beyonce?<br />
Dania: I like Beyonce because she’s a good singer and she helps people too.<br />
Me: How much do you know about Beyonce?<br />
Dania: Her name and the names of her songs.<br />
Me: Do you think Beyonce is a good role model? Why or why not?<br />
Dania: Yes, because she helps young kids want to be themselves.</p>
<p>Misty seemed to have the same opinion.</p>
<p>Me: Why do you like Beyonce?<br />
Misty: She’s inspiring.<br />
Me: How much do you know about Beyonce?<br />
Misty: Her name and bio.<br />
Me: Do you think that Beyonce is a good role model? Why or why not?<br />
Misty: Yes, she is a good role model because she teaches young girls to respect themselves.</p>
<p>Dania was correct about Beyonce helping people. Beyonce really likes to help people. According to the organization Look to the Stars, she supported 19 charities and foundations. Also, she and her husband Shawn Carter (Jay-Z) donated all of their baby daughter Blue Ivy’s baby shower gifts to local charities that help young mothers.<br />
I agree with Misty and Dania when they say that Beyonce helps young girls believe in themselves and have self respect through her music. I think that it is very important to have respect for yourself and be who you are. Beyonce teaches young girls like me to respect ourselves through her songs like “Survivor.” The chorus of the song is:<br />
I’m a survivor<br />
I’m not going to give up<br />
I’m not going to stop<br />
I’m going to work harder</p>
<p>That’s a really good message to young ladies who understand it and teaches young ladies who don’t.		</p>
