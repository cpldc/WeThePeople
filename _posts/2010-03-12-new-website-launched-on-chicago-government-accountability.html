<div>The Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, a social  justice group, which has been tracking and grading the progress of the  City of Chicago's' public services since 2007, launched a new website on  March 17, 2010 called Developing Government Accountability to the  People or (DGAP).<br />
The new website is designed for the public at  large to use to evaluate the performance of Mayor Richard M. Daley, and  their Aldermen's policies, practices and efforts concerning housing,  education, economic development, transportation, the environment,  criminal justice, and ethics and corruption.   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Wethepeoplemedia#p/u/0/zqNl2HsD-9E"><span style="color: #ba0107;">Click here to see Residents' Journal's video coverage  of the event.</span></a></div>
