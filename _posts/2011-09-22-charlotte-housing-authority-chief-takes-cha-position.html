<p>Carlos Ponce, interim chief of the Chicago Housing Authority is out, and Charles Woodyard, the CEO of the Charlotte Housing Authority since 2002, is in. Woodyard will govern CHA’s family and senior housing stock, and oversee the Plan for Transformation, which calls for 25,000 units of fully rehabilitated or renovated housing by 2015.</p>
<p>Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced today that Woodyard’s new position begins on October 24, and he added that Ponce will remain as a senior advisor “to help ensure a smooth transition.”</p>
<p>Ponce was put in place after former chief Lewis Jordan resigned after it was discovered that he and other CHA staff members were frivolously using credit cards for things not pertaining to the general operation of the public housing stock.</p>
<p>Emanuel said that Woodyard “has proven management ability and a history of innovation in public housing, and is the right man to lead the CHA to the successful completion of its Plan for Transformation and beyond,” stated Emanuel in a press release. “Throughout his career, Charles has focused on sound financial management and has dedicated himself to providing residents with affordable, sanitary and safe housing. In Charlotte, Charles was able to successfully integrate public housing into communities, a crucial element of Chicago’s Plan for Transformation. He has built strong partnerships with community groups and encouraged private sector investment in public housing, and we look forward to his leadership here in Chicago.”</p>

<p>In addition, Emanuel said the CHA’s Chairman of the Board “will no longer be compensated for services,” which former chairmen received at a rate of $100, 000 annually.</p>
<p>“This is another step in making sure taxpayer funds are being used effectively to provide the best services to the people of Chicago,” Emanuel said in his press release.</p>
<p>According to Emanuel, Woodyard “has 30 years of public sector experience, focusing on targeted asset management and engaging the entire community in providing the most effective public housing options for residents.”</p>
<p>Emanuel also announced today that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development “is going to provide technical assistance to CHA” as well as give advise to them to help them “weigh the utilization of new tools and approaches for preserving public housing.”		</p>
