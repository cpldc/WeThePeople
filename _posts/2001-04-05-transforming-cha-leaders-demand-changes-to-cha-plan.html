				Elected public housing  resident leaders and lawyers representing residents demanded changes to  the Chicago Housing Authority Plan for Transformation in recent letters,  press releases and phone calls to Mayor Richard M. Daley and CHA  officials.</p>
<p>Letters to the mayor and CHA Chairperson Sharon Gist-Gilliam state  residents’ complaints that CHA is neglecting to maintain occupied units,  violating the relocation rights contract and closing down buildings too  quickly. The late March and early April letters also state that CHA is  asking residents to make choices on where they want to relocate without  including information on whether they can stay on-site.<!--more--></p>
<p>“We have been patient and cooperative for over a year but we can wait no  longer to begin to address the severe adverse conditions cited above,"  states the initial March 27 letter signed by Mary Wiggins, Vice  Chairperson of the Central Advisory Council, and Alexander Polikoff, the  lead Gautreaux counsel.</p>
<p>“What is now required,” the letter states, “is an immediate, open and  compassionate balancing of redevelopment goals with CHA’s legal duty,  and its promissory obligation set forth in the Plan, to maintain  occupied units and to relocate residents in a reasonable manner&amp;.</p>
<p>In the March 27 letter, the Central Advisory Council (CAC) and Polikoff  threatened to take CHA to court on April 20 unless Daley and CHA  officials agreed to meet with them.</p>
<p>The resident leadership is not threatening to take CHA to just any court  but to the Gautreaux court. The Gautreaux case is a 1969 federal  de-segregation court order, which ruled that CHA scatter any new public  housing units throughout non-African American neighborhoods.</p>
<p>But Mayor Daley showed little concern about being taken to court. During  a March 31 press conference, Daley was asked to comment about the CAC's  threat to take CHA to Gautreaux court.</p>
<p>"There are so many lawyers in Chicago. Everyone sues everyone," Daley  said. "The Gautreaux decision has been a decision rendered in 1969 and  this is 2001."</p>
<p>Daley said he would trust CHA CEO Terry Peterson's judgement in dealing with the CAC's complaints. "I'll agree and sign on with what Terry Peterson says 100 percent," Daley said.</p>
<p>In response to Daley's comments, Polikoff, the lead attorney for the  Gautreaux court decree, told RJ during a telephone interview that the  Gautreaux decision is still continuing.</p>
<p>"The mayor is correct," Polikoff said. "It is a decision that was  rendered in 1969 and this is 2001. It is also true that the case is  still going on into 2001."</p>
<p>Polikoff said the purpose of the letter sent by him and the CAC was to ask to meet with the mayor and CHA CEO Terry Peterson.</p>
<p>"The CAC has asked him to join in a meeting with Terry Peterson to work  things out. This is not a litigation strategy. We're not trying to fight  with CHA," Polikoff said.</p>
<p>Polikoff said he was sure the mayor would be willing to join the meeting.</p>
<p>"I'm sure the mayor will be willing to do that," he said.</p>
<p>"And maybe they'll even be worked out before April 20 so we won't have  to file anything in court."  Polikoff said the purpose for taking CHA to the Gautreaux court would be  to bring the parties together.  "If we file with Judge Aspen in the Gautreaux case on April 20, as we  said we will do if we haven't worked things out satisfactorily before  hand, the purpose will be to ask the judge to bring the parties together  to talk and work things out," he said.</p>
<p>In a March 30 letter, the CAC and Polikoff ask CHA to stop the  relocation process until they meet. "We ask, therefore, that absent either a well-documented emergency or a  showing that particular relocation activities should cease until we have  had a mutual opportunity to resolve these concerns," the CAC and  Polikoff wrote.</p>
<p>The letter states that residents have reported that CHA is violating the  Relocation Rights Contract in Stateway Gardens and other areas.</p>
<p>The letter also states that CHA is not informing residents in the  process of being relocated about housing units that may be available in  their development.</p>
<p>"Of even greater importance, residents report that they are being asked  to make decisions about their housing choices without being provided  appropriate information about 'on-site' alternatives," Polikoff and the  CAC wrote.</p>
<p>CHA Chairperson Sharon Gist Gilliam responded to the CAC's March 27  letter by addressing each concern separately. In addressing the concern  about CHA's maintenance of occupied units during implementation of the  Plan, the letter states that CHA does not intend to continue to spend  money on the occupied units. "The Authority intends to obey federal law and demolish these units,  many of which are occupied and cannot be maintained in a safe and decent  condition," Gist-Gilliam wrote.</p>
<p>"It would neither be prudent nor responsible for the Authority  indefinitely to continue to expend scarce dollars in trying to maintain  these buildings when those dollars can be put to more productive uses of  creating or rehabbing new units, among other things."</p>
<p>The CAC and Polikoff responded to Gist-Gilliam in a letter dated April  5. They wrote that CHA is neglecting to repair units and buildings,  which may be creating emergency conditions.</p>
<p>"We are concerned that in its understandable desire to preserve scarce  capital dollars, CHA may be consolidating buildings too rapidly and may  be pushing buildings to emergency status prematurely by 'starving' them  of maintenance, before CHA is truly prepared to provide compassionate  relocation for all the families forced to move," they wrote.</p>
<p>I asked Peterson after the April 11 Tenant Services Meeting if CHA had  agreed to meet with the CAC and others. Peterson said CHA was working  with the CAC to set a date.</p>
<p>"I've called Ms. Bone (the CAC chairperson) and personally asked to sit  down with her. We're still talking about setting up a date," Peterson  said.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Peterson ordered management workers to go door to  door to survey which residents needed immediate emergency repairs  throughout CHA developments.</p>
<p>But resident leaders still want to meet with CHA and talk about a number  of issues. In a press release dated April 13, the Central Advisory  Council said they want to discuss funding for upkeep of the occupied  units while the Plan is being implemented as well as residents'  complaints about not receiving promised money for utility and phone  connections during relocation. The release also mentions that residents  are not being reimbursed for property that is lost and damaged when they  move.</p>
<p>"While these emergency repairs are an encouraging first step by the CHA  and City to address some of the more extreme housing conditions, a more  comprehensive and thoughtful process must be put in place to maintain  occupied housing units during the entire multi-year implementation  period," the release quotes CAC Vice Chairperson Wiggins.</p>
<p>The CAC wants to talk about residents' complaints that they are moving  into units that are in the same or worse condition than the apartments  they are leaving. The release also states that some residents are  receiving eviction notices for refusing to make a decision about their  housing choices. Many of those residents are refusing to sign their  housing choice documents because they say CHA is not providing  information about how many units will be built and how many will be  available.</p>
<p>"Under CHA's Plan, residents must compete in a lottery if enough units  are not built back at specific sites," the release states. "But CHA has  not provided how many will be available where, or what they will look  like."</p>
<p>The CAC wants to talk to CHA and City officials and find out why the  plan to employ residents and train them to monitor the Plan was never  carried out. The CAC also wants to talk about information that many  residents are moving into other low-income, largely African American  neighborhoods.</p>
<p>"Recent reports indicated that the majority of the families being  relocated under the Plan are being concentrated into communities that  are nearly as distressed and racially concentrated as the public housing  communities they formerly lived in, the release states.</p>
<p>"To create such communities again will defeat the purpose of the Plan,  squander scarce dollars, and require another whole new 'Plan' again in a  few years - it must be done right now."</p>
<p>As of Residents' Journal press deadline (April 16), the CAC, their attorneys and City officials have not met.		</p>
