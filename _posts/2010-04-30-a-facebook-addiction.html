				<strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.</p>
<p>At 2:55 p.m. as the bell rings for dismissal, I hurry to my locker to get my things. As I put my coat on, I only have one thing on my mind: Facebook.</p>
<p>Facebook addiction plays a major role in my life today.</p>
<p><!--more-->“I hardly talk on the phone, and I rarely watch TV because of the amount of time I spend on Facebook,” said South Shore School of Leadership senior Joseph Davis.</p>
<p>Facebook is just the latest incarnation of MySpace, which replaced Friendster, which replaced talking on the phone, which replaced actually talking to someone one-on-one.</p>
<p>With the ever-changing technologies and the ease with which you can stay in touch with someone while exerting little effort, social networking Web sites have become a dominant force for teens.</p>
<p>It allows for picture sharing, instant messaging, private messages, status updates and even the opportunity to leave a comment on what your friends write on their pages.</p>
<p>I interviewed several teenagers, and I discovered the main reason people create accounts on Facebook and MySpace is because it’s a source.</p>
<p>“If you want to know the latest drama with your peers, then create a Facebook account,” said South Shore School of Leadership senior Reginald Branch.		</p>
