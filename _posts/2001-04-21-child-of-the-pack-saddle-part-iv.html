<p>Two hours after I got into  the Model T Ford a few miles north of Marksville, five Cajuns and myself  pulled into a yellow two-car garage in the rear of a yellow duplex  house on Holly Street in Alexandria, Louisiana.</p>
<p>The interior of the garage was much larger than it appeared from the  outside: the floor was covered over with wall-to-wall concrete, there  was a two-pane window on one side of the garage, and at the far end,  there was an iron bed. All in all, the place was neat and well kept for a  garage.</p>
<p>After everyone had gotten out of the car and removed the fishing gear,  Caroline said to me, “Popcorn, you wait here while I go in the house and  get some bed clothing for the bed in the corner there where you’re  going to sleep. That will be your bed. You wait here and I'll be right  back."</p>
<p>I guess I waited out in the garage something like 25 to 30 minutes and  was getting a little uneasy when Roland walked in and said to me,  "Popcorn. </p>
<p> Uncle Johnny told me to tell you to come in the house.  Grandmother wants to see you. Come with me."<!--more--></p>
<p>The distance between the garage and the back porch was about ten yards  or so. It was one of those screened-in porches with a couple of chairs, a  couple of buckets, a mop and a couple of brooms at the far end of the  porch.</p>
<p>The kitchen door was half ajar when Roland pushed it all the way open  and as we walked into the kitchen. My eyes were met by a bright white  light bulb hanging from the ceiling. Facing the door was a full-length  window with a red and blue curtain covering the four-pane window. The  blue wall-to-wall linoleum glowed as brilliantly as a new moon in the  month of June.</p>
<p>Directly across from the kitchen door was a huge black iron stove with  four large burners and a small burner for the coffee pot. At the bottom  of the stove was a large oven with a glass door in the middle of the  door and lording above the stove was an oven for keeping prepared food  warm. Overhead and directly opposite the stove, a row of varnished  cabinets lined the wall. Below those cabinets was a small breakfast  table. A little farther down from table sat a kitchen sink and hovering  over the sink was a window bearing white-laced curtains.</p>
<p>I was completely fascinated by the order and the arrangement of the  kitchen from the moment that I laid eyes on this eye-catching scene. I  thought to myself, "What a way to live. It must surely be heavenly."</p>
<p>When Roland and I walked into the kitchen, Johnny and Caroline were  cleaning the fish and Jesse and his wife were busy unpacking the fishing  gear. Upon entering the kitchen, Roland walked over to the breakfast  table where a white-haired woman sat sipping from a coffee cup. He  placed his arm over the shoulder of the pretty white-headed woman seated  at the table with her back to the kitchen door and said to her - in  French – “This is Popcorn, Granny. The little colored boy that aunt  Caroline was telling you about."</p>
<p>The lady turned toward me, looked up and down for a moment, and then  said to Roland, “Why, this boy is too young to be out hitching&amp;how  do you say?"</p>
<p>“The word is hitchhiking, Granny,” said Roland. “He was walking out of  Marksville when Uncle Johnny picked him up on Highway 1. He say he come  from New Orleans from Alex searching for his mama who lives somewhere in  the colored neighborhood here in Alexandria."</p>
<p>"What is his mama doing in this town when her child is in New Orleans?" the woman questioned.</p>
<p>"I don't know, Granny," Roland said. "Don't start me to lying!"</p>
<p>“Come closer to me, boy,” the old woman said to me. “Now tell me the  truth: Can you speak French? And if you can, who teach you to speak  French? Your mama, is she a Cajun woman? I kin see you ain’t all Black  ‘cause you no have big mouth like most colored folks have. You got Cajun  blood in you, ain't you? You talk good French.</p>
<p>“Take that chair over there and bring it close here. I want you to tell  me how come you out in the world all by yourself. And I don't want no  lies! You hear me? I know you little colored boys will sugar coat the  truth."</p>
<p>After I had complied with the lady's order to pull the chair closer to  where she sat, she touched me on my knee and said to me, “I want you to  tell me how come you out here on the road at night coming from New  Orleans all the way to Alex to find a mama and you don't know for sure  where she stay.</p>
<p>"Look at me when you talk. I don't like when people look at the floor  when they are supposed to be talking to me. Do you understand what I'm  saying to you&amp;er,er&amp;What is your name?"</p>
<p>"They call me Popcorn miss, miss"</p>
<p>“My name is La Nora but you can call me Granny. Everyone calls me Granny  and I don’t see no reason how come you shouldn’t. Just call me Granny  and I’ll call you Popcorn. And I don’t want you to forget that when you  talking to Granny, you look she in the face. That is how I kin know when  you tell a lie or you tell the truth. Now, tell Granny: Who is Cajun in  your family? Where is your home and how come you come to Alexandria?"</p>
<p>I have gone through a lot of experiences but never, ever have I had an  experience that equaled the kind of ordeal that I had with that  white-haired old lady called Granny. The influence that she wove over me  in no time at all was something that I had never felt before nor I have  I felt since.</p>
<p>The old woman seemed to cast a spell over me. It was as though looking  into her clear blue eyes robbed me of every shred of deception that my  mind might have conjured up or even dared to concoct. It did, indeed,  seem to me that her unblinking eyes bore the mystic threat of dire  consequences should I dare wander off the true blue path of truth for  the slightest reason to deceive.</p>
<p>I had no desire to deceive this woman who seemed to be plucking my very  heart from my bosom bit by bit. And yet, that was of no consequences to  me, none at all, ya’ll. By way of surrendering to her will, I told her  the why and the real why for that I ran away from home right down to the  last detail. I told her my very first recollection of life and living  to the moment I gazed into her bewitching blue eyes. And by the time it  all ended, I was only an inch or two from sitting in her lap while she  sat holding my hand.</p>
<p>Upon completing my story, Granny said to me, “I know that what you told  me is the truth. And you need not to worry. This can be your home for as  long as you want it to be. Go now. Caroline will fix your bed in the  garage for you tonight and tomorrow we will fix you a room in the  basement. Good night, Popcorn."</p>
<p>Our eyes were still bound in fond admiration and our clasp in mutual friendship when I said, “Can I ask you something, Granny?"</p>
<p>“Sure you kin,” said Granny. “Ask me. I know you told me that everybody  call you Granny but, if you don’t mind me doing so, I would like to call  you Miss La Nora. Can I?"</p>
<p>“Well, bless your heart!” said Granny, squeezing my hand with her two  hands. “It’s wonderful to hear you say that, Popcorn. I ain’t been  called La Nora in many, many, years. My husband used to call me La Nora.  You is a good boy, Popcorn. A good, good, boy!"</p>
<p>Along about that time, Johnny and Caroline walked over and Johnny said,  What is going on over here with all this shouting and squeaking,  Granny?"</p>
<p>Pulling me into her lap, Granny said to Johnny, “You will never believe  what this child called me, John.” “Oh, no!” said Johnny. “Well, I hope  and pray he didn’t get indecent with you, Granny. Then I’ll be forced to  cut his throat and Id hate to have Black blood all over your new waxed  floor."</p>
<p>Caroline said between chuckles, “Don’t do it, Johnny. Please. Because if  you do it as close as Granny is to him when you swing at him, youll  cut her throat too."</p>
<p>The next two weeks were the happiest days that I had known in all the  length and width of the 12 years that I had been on this God-given  Earth. I was happy for the very first time. I had peace in my soul, joy  in my life and love in my heart. My past was completely and totally  obliterated from my memory. It was as if I had never lived a single day  beyond the present day and time.</p>
<p>There is song that says, “Joy comes with the morning.” But not so with  this little Black Creole. My joy came with the morning, with the noon  and the night! Yes, I was in love for the very first time and what truer  love can there be in this world than that of love that is as innocent  as the heart of a baby boy.</p>
<p>True love is infinite. It is immeasurable. It is ageless and  unpretentious. True love is unselfish, non-biased and honorable. True  love is the pride and the joy of the heart. And he who finds true love  has, indeed, found a treasure that makes the treasures housed in Fort  Knox seem like a piggy bank in comparison.</p>
<p>My lodging in the garage was a night of joy and unrivalled comfort, to  say the very least. I slept like a baby the live-long night from the  moment that I had laid my head on the big white pillow that Caroline  blessed me with on into the sunbathed morning when I was awakened by  Johnny’s baby sister, Bettie, whom I had met the night before due to the  fact that she had gone over to her sisters house Anne on a weekend  visit.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks following my arrival at the Torque household, Miss La  Nora, my true love, and myself were out in the front yard. I was  watering the lawn and Miss La Nora was planting flowers when a squad car  pulled up at the front yard.  The policeman got out and walked over to where Miss La Nora knelt  planting flowers. At first, I assumed that what the two were talking  about was no concern of mine. And so, ignoring the whole affair, I  continued with the task of watering the lawn and humming my little tune.  But I could not have been more wrong, awry or amiss had I been  attempting to extinguish a burning house with an eye dropper.</p>
