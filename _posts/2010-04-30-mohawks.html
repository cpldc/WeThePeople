				<strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.</p>
<p>Watch out! It’s a plane! It’s a bird! No … It’s a new haircut?</p>
<p>Mohawks are taking South Shore School of Leadership by storm.</p>
<p>Stefan Robertson, a senior at South Shore School of Leadership, said he wears Mohawks because they are different.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Stefan also said that other people in his family have worn this hairstyle. His whole family rocked this style during the New Year’s celebration last year.</p>
<p>When I asked what he thought about people who don’t like the style he said “most people who talk trash about it end up getting it anyway.”</p>
<p>But Daryl Pinkston, another senior, thinks otherwise. He said people who wear Mohawks look stupid and the only reason guys get the hairstyle is to impress girls.</p>
<p>When I asked Daryl would he ever get the hairstyle, he said he would consider it only if designs were incorporated into the haircut.</p>
<p>First worn by Native American tribes, then punk rockers in the 80’s, this trendy hairstyle has been widely adopted. According to Wikipedia there are various styles of the Mohawk.</p>
<p>Color hawks are worn with all different colors; death hawks are Mohawks worn with the Gothic look; reverse hawks shave a center strip while leaving the sides alone; and there are many more.</p>
<p>It was just the other day when I saw a baby at Wal-Mart with a Mohawk.</p>
<p>They are everywhere and worn by everyone: young and old, boy and girl, black and white.</p>
<p>Usually styles last for a certain time period, it’s a new year and the Mohawk is still going strong as it was last year when Stefan’s family had them.</p>
<p>Will this style ever die?		</p>
