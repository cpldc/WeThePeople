				<strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.</p>
<p>South Shore School of Leadership senior Brittney Walter, 19, was sitting at her computer when she got a message from an unknown person.</p>
<p>When Brittney checked her message, it said: “Hey gurl wat up with you?”</p>
<p>Brittney said she was surprised. She checked out the profile. She saw the age. He was 25.</p>
<p><!--more-->Many teens have been meeting other people from the Internet.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the non-profit Internet watchdog Enough is Enough, 69 percent of teens regularly received personal messages online from people they don’t know, and most of them don’t tell trusted adults about it.</p>
<p>Brittney was surprised that he was that old, and when she denied the friend request, she got a message from the unknown stranger. The message said, “What up shawty.”</p>
<p>Brittney thought about replying. So, two minutes later, she replied and said, “Hi, wats up.” She was a little nervous because she wasn’t used to talking to an older guy.</p>
<p>The day went on, and they talked and got to know each other a little bit more.</p>
<p>The guy wanted to come from out of state to see her. So when he asked Brittney if that could happen, she said, “No.”</p>
<p>When she said no, he got upset and wanted to come out anyway, but didn’t.		</p>
