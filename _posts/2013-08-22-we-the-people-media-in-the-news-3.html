<p>I was honored recently to guest host "Chicago Newsroom," the weekly public affairs show hosted by media legend Ken Davis and broadcast over the CAN TV network. My guests were the estimable Chris Robling, vice president at Jayne Thompson Associates and a frequent Republican commentator, and Dave Lundy, principal atÂ  Aileron Communications and a frequent Democratic commentator. We discussed Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's tenure so far as well as state politics and the upcoming governor's race. You can watch the show by clicking on the photo above.</p>
<p>By coincidence, the same day, I was also a guest on "Morning Shift" over WBEZ Chicago Public Radio discussing the arrest of two community leaders on charges of lobbying for Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe. You can listen to the show <a href="https://soundcloud.com/morningshiftwbez/writer-offers-window-into-the?utm_source=soundcloud&amp;utm_campaign=wtshare&amp;utm_medium=Facebook&amp;utm_content=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fmorningshiftwbez%2Fwriter-offers-window-into-the">here</a>:</p>
