				<strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.</p>
<p>In everyday life, people are making and setting bad examples for the little kids. They should be teaching them to do the right thing instead of the wrong thing. Yesterday there was a march in this community about preventing drugs and violence. I think that is a good thing, but I wonder does that happen in other neighborhoods in everyday life. Nowadays it seems like so many people around here are being killed for little or no reason. Sometimes it seems like just the everyday grind is too much. On top of all of their other worries, the Wells is being torn down and they're being told they have to move into unfamiliar neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Recently there was a big police raid in the Ida B. Wells extensions and they arrested a lot of the men and boys who live or hang out there. After it was all over, the city installed police cameras behind the building on Browning and on the street at Vincennes. The drug dealers have had to move from over there, and at least the little kids can come back out to play again. Things like drugs and guns are a real problem in everyday life here. What we need around this place is some unity. That would be a real plus if we could start getting together and helping one another out. Maybe then everyday life wouldn't be so hard.<br />

The Wells is a place that is filled with many different sights and sounds on a daily basis. If you close your eyes and listen, you can hear people yelling, babies crying, mothers cursing, basketballs bouncing, car stereo systems, laughter among friends, rapping, singing, people cracking jokes, boyfriends and girlfriends arguing, kids playing and car horns honking.</p>
<p>One day soon I hope that everyone will work out their problems and differences, but if they don’t, I know that too is a part of everyday life.		</p>
