				In a response to the recent escalating violence aimed at youth in the city’s neighborhoods, Chicago’s public access station, CAN TV will devote an entire day to programming produced by residents whose communities have been affected by violence.<br />
The “Stop the Violence” programming will be cablecast from 10:30 a.m. – 11:00 p.m. on Saturday, June 27 on cable channel CAN TV19. The day begins with a live one-hour panel and call-in show featuring community leaders from the Chicago Public Schools, the 6th Ward and Bronzeville.<br />
Other programming for the day includes, first person accounts of parents, like 2009 Father of the Year Ron Holt, who’ve lost children to violence, a dance group offering an alternative to gang life, youth created work trying to make sense of the violence, and community residents active in anti-violence work.<br />
On June 27, at 5 p.m., a documentary will air featuring interviews with gang members and street hustlers warning youth about the dangers of life on the streets.<br />
