<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">Martin Luther King Jr. was the leader of the civil rights movement. Sadly, he was shot. He was a great leader and a pastor following in his father’s footsteps. King was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia. He was very little when he first wondered why blacks and whites were segregated. He didn’t graduate from high school, but instead went straight to Morehouse College at the age of 15.  Then, in 1954, he became a pastor at the age of 25.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">He married Coretta Scott and had four children, named Yolanda, Martin III, Dexter and Bernice. King was very passionate. He met Rosa Parks at the Montgomery Bus Boycott. He was angry about the way blacks were treated and how the whites were treated better than them.</span></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">He later gave his famous “I Have a Dream” speech, basically saying that he wished black and white children could play together and black and white adults could get along too. Most people agreed with him about stopping segregation. Then he was shot by a white man.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Cambria','serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: 'ＭＳ 明朝'; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">About 20 years later, the country created a holiday called Martin Luther King Day.</span></p>
<p />
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">“He accomplished so much<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>for so many people,” teaching instructor Steve “Dusty” Rhodes said.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">"He basically ended segregation,” said Donoghue student Reggie Brown.</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> “</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;">He ended segregation and saved a lot of people in the world who were getting beaten because of the colors on their body.”</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black;"> And that’s why Martin Luther King Jr. is remembered to this day.</span></p>
