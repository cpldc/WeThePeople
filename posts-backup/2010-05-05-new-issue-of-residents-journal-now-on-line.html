Johns and Crystal Medina's special coverage of the situation in post-Katrina New Orleans; Jacqueline Thompson's article about the final phase of the Harold L. Ickes Homes; Quintana Woodridge's continuing coverage of how low-income households in Chicago are dealing with the Digital TV transition; and, of course, a new set of articles from the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.
