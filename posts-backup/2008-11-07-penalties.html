				<strong>Editorâ€™s Note:</strong> The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.</p>
<p>Some citizens of Chicago have had a hard time finding a way to re-enter society and be able to fee themselves and their families. Sometimes people aren't able to come back to their homes, especially if they live in CHA apartments or Section 8 homes.</p>
<p>There has always been a one-strike law that was put in place to get rid of people in public housing that have records or have committed a criminal offense. A lot of people don't agree with the one-strike law, but it's usually the people that are involved in illegal activities. The problem with the one-strike law is when someone, especially an older person, loses their apartment because someone on their lease does something wrong. For example, in CHA buildings when someone is caught selling drugs on the premises, they will get arrested and the whole family can be evicted under the one-strike policy. It may not be fair, but that's life.<br />

To me, it seems that poor people always pay the stiffest penalties. Maybe it's because they are ignorant to the law and often can't afford to hire a lawyer. When people do things that may jeopardize their home they have to stop and think, what will be the penalty for my actions? They say there are consequences to everything you do and I believe that. In the new development, Oakwood Shores, there are many rules and almost all bad violations of those rules mean you can get evicted. So be careful what you do if you don't want to pay the penalty.		</p>
