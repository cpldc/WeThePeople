				<strong> </strong><span style="font-size: small;">T</span>he Chicago Housing  Authority recently put out a large contract to the City Department of  Human Services to run the Service Connector program, which is supposed  to start this summer.</p>
<div>But the Service Connector program started last November. Residents who  applied to the  Service Connector program were supposed to be trained by  AmeriCorps. The program aimed to hire two residents from each  development. Two residents from Lathrop Homes, for example, went into  the AmeriCorps training program.  After completing training, an office is supposed to be set up on the  development this summer. The two residents hired were supposed to work  with other residents to make the relocation transition easier and to  help with social issues, jobs, educational programs, family statistics  and anything else that might benefit residents.<!--more--></p>
<p>I spoke with one resident who was with the AmeriCorps program. She had  applied to work with the Service Connector program. She was trained at  one of the City Human Services Department centers. She felt she would  have been qualified to really benefit residents at the end of their  training. But she left before the end of the training because she felt  she was lied to.</p>
<p>She was told at the beginning of the program that she would be paid $750  every other week. But during the training, she was only given $391  twice monthly and a $4,800 scholarship at the end of the program.  Now I understand the program is about to get off the ground. If it works  the way it is proposed, the Service Connector program will coordinate  services, help residents with economic and self-sufficiency, lease  compliance, employment, and family stability.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the services that will be available for  residents under the provisions of the CHA transformation. As well as  these services, there will be case managers and resident service  advocates and service coordinators for each development. Letâ€™s hope this  will better prepare residents for the new change.</p>
