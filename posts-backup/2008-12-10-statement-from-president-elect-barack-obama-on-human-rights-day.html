				<em>Editor’s Note: Today is Human Rights Day, and due to the time restraints in obtaining direct comments from President-elect Barak Obama in a timely fashion. I have decided to placed the below Statement from him regarding Human Rights Day in its entirety. The information was provided to Residents’ Journal and other news publications by the President-elect’s Transition Team Office. </em></p>
<p>"When the United States stands up for human rights, by example at home and by effort abroad, we align ourselves with men and women around the world who struggle for the right to speak their minds, to choose their leaders, and to be treated with dignity and respect. We also strengthen our security and well being, because the abuse of human rights can feed many of the global dangers that we confront -- from armed conflict and humanitarian crises, to corruption and the spread of ideologies that promote hatred and violence.</p>
<p>"So on this Human Rights Day, let us rededicate ourselves to the advancement of human rights and freedoms for all, and pledge always to live by the ideals we promote to the world," said President-elect Obama.		</p>
