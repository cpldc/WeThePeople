				<strong> </strong><span style="font-size: small;">E</span>ditor's Note: Dear Resident  is on vacation this month. In honor of Black History Month, the column  below reprints the Dear Resident column from February 2000</p>
<div>Despite the mild to moderate to monumental Y2K disaster predictions,  here we are, just like the rest of Chicago, safe and sound in the new  millennium.</p>
<p>Here we are with the same old new challenge of how to improve the  quality of life for public housing residents and the same new old  problems.</p>
<p>Old problems affect more of our young people at even earlier age,  causing them to fall victim to something that can only be described as a  cultural plague.<!--more--></p>
<p>A culture of single, female head of households, below-average elementary  school students (too many classified as having behavioral disorders),  high school drop-outs, teen-age parents, young criminal offenders, very  young, young, old and even older substance abusers in a national  atmosphere of violence, violent music and violent movies. All of this,  coupled with confusion and anger and more anger with respect to their  place in society. Young people today do not view our position in society  and societys position on us as reasonably as past generations.</p>
<p>By no means are these cultural ills exclusive to public housing. Unlike  past generations, when a culture was what you did, today a culture is  what you become. And things will continue in the same old way. So we  thought. So we think? Truly, the only difference between the old and new millennium was the  nanosecond when 1999 became 2000.</p>
<p>What was the old millennium rolled over into the new millennium just  like the numbers on a clock. Little else changed for most of us, unless  we were already in the midst of change when the new millennium struck.</p>
<p>Change, for the most part, even when it seems radical (extreme), is slow  and methodical (arranged, characterized by or performed with method and  order). Sometimes change results from careful planning and manipulative  cunning (the ability to change by artful or unfair means so as to serve  one’s own purpose). Every once in a while, but not often, change is  sheer happenstance or coincidence.</p>
<p>But if nothing else, change is necessary. There can be no progress  without it. There can be no movement without it. We would be stuck in  time. And we have been for a long time.</p>
<p>While the new millennium did not bring catastrophic change, change will  come. Change will come gradually. Change will come methodically.  Especially for the old, outdated, burdensome, effortful (full of effort)  concepts of the old millennium like public housing in Chicago. Public  housing is not just groups and rows of red and white high-rise  structures that signal danger, death and drugs to most and home to  others.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the old millennium, and not only in Chicago, public housing  went from a place to live to a way to live. It became a culture (the  ideas, customs, skills, arts, etc. of a people or group in a particular  period or place that are transferred, communicated or passed along in or  to succeeding generations).</p>
<p>Originally, public housing was a social program accompanied by other  social programs designed to improve the quality of life for Americas  less fortunate.</p>
<p>But somewhere in the old millennium, the “fortunate” financially and  physically withdrew support from America’s social programs. The  fortunate began living in such a manner that it appeared they would not,  could not, be affected by the ills of societys less fortunate.</p>
<p>Now, the “fortunate” ones realize that nothing could be further from the  truth. Their pulling away from society and its norms left behind a  sub-society that then evolved into a culture with own norms. Today,  while many cultures may exist in America, we are still, if nothing else,  one society. While many things may separate the fortunate from the less  fortunate, physical space is not one of them.</p>
<p>Once again, society sees the need to improve the quality of life for  America’s less fortunate. Without a doubt, you can tear down public  housing. But can you tear down its culture?</p>
<p>For as long as a society has members, its cultures are sustained.  Unfortunately, not only are they sustained.  In our case, culture is fueled by confused, angry youth who do not see  any way out, who work to optimize (develop to the utmost extent) the  culture. Add to that the societal differences and you have two things  that hinder change more than anything else; a lack of understanding and  distrust.</p>
<p>So, while we have no choice, can we trust society to look out for our  best interest again? Do they care about our problems or the fact that we  pose a problem to them?</p>
<p>The culture of public housing is such that most residents seem as  hopeless as the structures in which we live. They are totally immersed  in the culture, unaware of much else. For culture, too, is slow and  methodical. Like the fortunate, many of us live here somehow thinking  that we cannot be touched by the ills of our society or maybe we just  accept it. But slowly, we lose our children, our families and our lives  to the culture of public housing.</p>
<p>In any culture/society, it is the “survival of the fittest.” Only the  fit will survive. Like everything around us, we must change. Ultimately,  we will change for the better or worse anyway. So why not change for  the better?</p>
<p>We must become fit if we are to survive and prosper. And we must help  one another become physically, mentally, emotionally and financially  fit. We must learn and teach our children a new way to live.</p>
<p>The new millennium has also increased the speed with which social  generations evolve. While family generations remain the same, a social  generation is a high school graduating class that occurs each year.</p>
<p>Therefore, we lose a social generation every year that the majority of  our young people fail to graduate high school with their graduating  class. In addition to becoming high school drop-outs, they become social  drop-outs as well, unable to function in society, many confined,  physically and mentally, to their public housing community.</p>
<p>Perhaps the question should not be “Can we trust society?” but “Can we  trust our collective self to work together to improve the quality of  life for our future and our children?</p>
<p>Surely, some of us remember the promise of hope for our children’s  future as we held them in our arms. The hope and desire for an  opportunity for a better life for them and their children. If they are  to have the hope of this promise, we must change. We must become slow  and methodical or lose more of our children, even whole families, to our  culture. We must do what we can to keep the promise of hope. I will.  Will you?</p>
<p>Hopefully,<br />
