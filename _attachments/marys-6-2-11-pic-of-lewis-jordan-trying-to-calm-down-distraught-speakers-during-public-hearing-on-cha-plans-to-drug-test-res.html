excerpt: "\n\t\t\t\tChicago Housing Authority chief Lewis Jordan tries to calm down
  distraught tenants and their advocates at the Charles A. Hayes Family Investment
  Center the evening of Jun 2, 2011, during the public hearing to comment on the CHAâ€™s
  plan to drug test all public housing tenants, and to also take away their defense
  provision in court proceedings to evict them if a family member or friend on their
  lease commits a crime on or off CHA property, regardless if the leaseholder had
  any knowledge of it.  Photo by Mary C. Piemonte\t\t"
