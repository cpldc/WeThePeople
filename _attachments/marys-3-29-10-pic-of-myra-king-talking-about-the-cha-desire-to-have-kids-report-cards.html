excerpt: "\n\t\t\t\tMyra King, chairman of the tenants’ Central Advisory Council,
  telling CHA officials that their desire to have residents’ kids reports cards was
  “unfair and discriminatory” and that the she and other tenants would “refuse” to
  sign the release documents for CPS to turn them over to the CHA, during the public
  hearing on proposed amendments to the CHA Admissions and Continued Occupancy Policy,
  at the Charles A. Hayes Family Investment Center, on March 29, 2010. Photo by Mary
