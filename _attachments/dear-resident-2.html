excerpt: "\n\t\t\t\tThis image depicts a mural which was painted on the walls of a
  building owned by the Tranquility Marksman Association, founded by the late Marion
  Stamps, a tireless crusader for the rights of Cabrini-Green tenants. The building
  stood at Clybourn Avenue and Division Street until it was demolished several years
  ago. Photo by Patricia Johnson-Gordon\t\t"
