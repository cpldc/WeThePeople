				<strong>Editorâ€™s Note:</strong> The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.</p>
<p>Lillian Piotrowski Park is one of everyone's childhood memories. Every day that has decent weather you can find the park full of kids. Whether it's on the playground or in the gym or the pool.</p>
<p>Today at this fine establishment is Early Voting.<br />
<!--more--><br />
Everywhere I go around the park there are banners or posters about Early Voting today.</p>
<p>I have seen many adults and several 18-year olds coming out to vote, to voice their opinions.<br />
br&gt; The Park is also very decorated with the spirit of Halloween just around the corner.</p>
<p>In today's world every vote counts.</p>
<p>I am on the main stage where I am seeing the break dancing club from LVLHS.		</p>
