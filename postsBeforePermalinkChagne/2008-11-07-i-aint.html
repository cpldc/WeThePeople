				<strong>Editorâ€™s Note:</strong> The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.</p>
<p><strong>I ain't a crackhead</strong><br />
I have way more respect for myself<br />
Than to be out here getting high taking risks with my health<br />
I don't want to be a mental slave to any drug<br />
Squatting in a vacant apartment on a dirty floor covered with bugs<br />
I'll never be walking the streets in search of coke<br />
While I watch my future go up in smoke<br />
I'm way too sophisticated and way too educated<br />
To be overdosing or getting hooked<br />
The only thing I'm overdosing on is the books<br />
I don't have all day to be on security<br />
Because that shows a lack of maturity<br />
I don't have time to sleep standing up<br />
I have bigger plans for when I grow up<br />
I plan on getting the best education and not being misled<br />
Whatever I do, I ain't going to be no crackhead<br />
<!--more--><br />
<strong>I ain't no killer</strong><br />
I'd rather save a life<br />
Because murderers don't think twice<br />
Not until they're locked up and never coming home<br />
Convicted in court, now that's two lives gone<br />
Two more Black people gone for no reason<br />
Killers roam the streets with guns like its hunting season<br />
The old people live in fear and little kids can't go out and play<br />
Especially when there's a shootout and they get in the way<br />
This year like others we'll see t-shirts of deceased loved ones<br />
This year like others people will die because someone got beat up and ran to get a gun<br />
When someone gets killed they always say he was at the right place at the wrong time but it seems to me<br />
If someone is shooting at you, no matter what time it is that's the wrong place to be</p>
<p><strong>I ain't a liar</strong><br />
I prefer the truth be the only thing that crosses my lips<br />
There's not a dishonest bone in my body from toes to fingertips<br />
Sometimes people lie to spare others' feelings<br />
But to me that's just shady dealings<br />
Is lying really a must?<br />
What happened to the trust?<br />
Parents lie to their children thinking we can't handle the real<br />
They don't take the time out to see how we feel<br />
They say the truth shall set you free, then I'm free as the wind<br />
Rumors, gossip, and snitching are all part of the trend<br />
I try to stay away from falsehoods and deceit<br />
If you didn't hear me the first time, don't worry I'll repeat<br />
I ain't no liar</p>
<p><strong>I ain't a dropout</strong><br />
I ain't dropping out because there ain't nothing in the streets<br />
I can be somewhere in class instead of getting in petty beefs<br />
I need to learn anyway<br />
I'm not just living for today<br />
If I want to have a future I need to stay in school<br />
Because we all know there's nothing worse than a grown fool<br />
I realize there's nothing wrong with being book smart and that's the truth<br />
I can look around my hood every day and see the proof<br />
If I don't know something I need to find out<br />
I'm not going to get what I need to succeed sitting in the house on my couch that's why I'm never dropping out</p>
<p><strong>I ain't no criminal</strong><br />
Sometimes I sit and dream looking at the stars<br />
Wondering about all of the people spending their lives behind bars<br />
Going back and forth to jail that's too many times<br />
Not even getting anything out of committing all of their crimes<br />
But nowadays everybody wants to be a thug or worse<br />
Sticking up, snatching money until someone gets hurt<br />
When you're grown and can't get a job because of the x's on your back<br />
You'll know that going to jail just pulls your life of track<br />
Committing crime looks fun but then they take it too far<br />
Your mom, kids, or girl will be crying when you're in the back of a that blue and white police car<br />
I see people doing the wrong thing and only getting the bare minimal<br />
Me, I'm staying in school 'cause I ain't no criminal</p>
<p><strong>I ain't ignorant</strong><br />
I happen to be very smart<br />
And I know that having an education will take me very far<br />
I go to school and try to do my best<br />
Some days I'm tired as ever without any rest<br />
When I lie in my bed and close my eyes<br />
I'm thinking about what if I had died<br />
Other than that I have no worries<br />
Just a bunch of stories<br />
I've learned a lot of things and there's one I must confess<br />
Education to me is the key to success<br />
Knowing things and people will help you make it in life<br />
But you'll never make it treating your life like a game of dice</p>
<p><strong>I ain't a drug dealer</strong><br />
I'm a young black man that thinks a lot about school<br />
I don't sell drugs because selling drugs to blacks is cruel<br />
Drug dealers are wild and don't care<br />
Where will they go? Some don't know where<br />
They will get locked up, kidnapped, or end up dead<br />
I ain't a drug dealer because I've got too much in my head<br />
I ain't a drug dealer because killing ain't right<br />
The drugs they sell really take lives, that's why I stay focused with all my might<br />
Getting money is a lot, but taking lives is more<br />
Killing someone else's family members is like killing one of yours<br />
I don't sell drugs because there are many more ways to hustle for dough<br />
No matter how much money you've got if your selling drugs you're living low<br />
I want to do something with my life that'll make my mother, family and friends proud<br />
So if you didn't hear me at first, I'll say it loud<br />
I ain't no drug dealer</p>
<p><strong>I ain't a thief</strong><br />
I'm a young, funny and athletic dude<br />
All around smart and most of the time cool I love to play basketball inside or on the streets<br />
Whatever you want to call me don't call me a thief<br />
I don't take money or watches to tell the time<br />
I don't need to steal, I can earn mine<br />
Money, cars, clothes, and everything flashy<br />
Why steal things when I'm better off asking?<br />
Air Force Ones and Girbauds I don't need to take<br />
Nor Jordans, Rocawear, or Bathing Apes<br />
Anything new that I ain't rocking<br />
They think that I'm gonna steal that's why the store owner is watching<br />
They make sure when I'm walking out they know what I've got<br />
Like I don't now if I don't I didn't pay for something they'll call the cops<br />
I'm an honest guy who's mostly nice<br />
Thinking I'm a thief is the wrong stereotype<br />
I'm not dumb, a dropout or hopeless<br />
I'm really just the opposite in case you didn't notice</p>
<p><strong>I ain't a bustdown</strong><br />
I'd rather be compared to a princess<br />
Yes, the best of the best<br />
Nonetheless Relax your nerves and take a rest<br />
I'm not anybody's piece on me you can't put a price<br />
So if you think I'm that nice I'd advise you to think twice<br />
I'm not a street walker<br />
So beat it if you're a sweet talker<br />
It's hard for me to believe<br />
That I cannot succeed<br />
Ask anyone, it's certain<br />
That I am a unique person<br />
I always show my true personality<br />
This is no joke its reality<br />
Check my background<br />
It'll show that I ain't a bustdown</p>
<p><strong>I ain't a gangbanger</strong><br />
And today that's alright<br />
I'd much rather play basketball than shoot someone or fight<br />
I don't have to claim a gang and I'll be just fine<br />
At school I'll be carrying my work instead of drugs or a nine<br />
I will fight and strive for As and Bs<br />
Instead of being in the middle of wars between GDs and BDs<br />
I want people to respect me for my education<br />
Not because I beat someone up at the train station<br />
Don't guess I'm in a gang because of my clothes or looks<br />
If the police search my bookbag they'll only find my ankle brace and books<br />
I'd much rather be somewhere hoping or chilling with a little honey<br />
Than standing on the corner with my hat turned trying to make some money<br />
I've learned that the ones that think they're cool turn out to be the biggest fools<br />
That's exactly why I'm staying my butt in school<br />
I know that with good connections and education my life won't have limitations<br />
There won't be a need for rehabilitation or restoration because I have all the basic information.<br />
We're not any of those negative stereotypes, but it's easy for us to become them.<br />
We are the future<br />
Exactly what we become in the future is up to us<br />
Peace.		</p>
