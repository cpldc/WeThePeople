				My father Jimmy Cain works for DCFS (the Department of Children and Family Services). I asked him and a student involved with the DCFS system for an inside look at the system.<br />
Jimmy Cain started working for DCFS in 1976 at the Lawrence Hall School for Boys.</p>
<p>"I was 22 when I discovered working with kids was for me," he said. "At that time of my life I had a lot of energy and I also saw many situations that kids were in. I saw their faces light up when I participated in activities with them and though their ages werenâ€™t that far from mine, I learned that I needed to bee firm and consistent but fair. This also helped me in my household."</p>
<p><!--more--><br />
He said it is a very stressful job but he is always willing to go back the next day "because a lot of the time the smile on the kids' faces will relieve some of my stress."<br />
"The things I enjoy most about my job are helping unfortunate kids who need me and also working with co-workers as a team," he said. "It makes me feel sad which motivates me to want to help. I feel that it affects the kids in a positive way because we as staff are helping to put back things that are missing in their lives."</p>
<p>A student in DCFS who asked to remain anonymous said, "Being part of DCFS sometimes makes me feel very sad, stressed and sometimes it makes me feel like I stand out from others.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel that my friends can be disrespectful to my parents because of the fact that they know my guardian is not really my real parent. I sometimes feel that they don't treat my parent like I treat theirs."<br />
The student has been a part of DCFS since infancy.<br />
"My mother and father are both on drugs and have no way of being proper parents to me or my four sisters. I have always had to be the mother and father pretty much to my little sisters because I have no parents. Being in DCFS affects me mentally but I am glad I have a home with a guardian who I feel cares for me. I am thankful because I could have been on one of those group homes unhappy."		</p>
