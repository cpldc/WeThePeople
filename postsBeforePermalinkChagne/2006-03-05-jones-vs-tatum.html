<p><strong><em>RJ </em></strong>recently interviewed State Representative Lovanna Jones.</p>
<p><strong><em>RJ: </em></strong>Many of your constituents are worried about the public schools that are closing in your boundaries. What do you plan to do to address that?</p>
<p><strong>LJ:</strong> I’m very upset with [CPS CEO]Arne Duncan. I don’t understand why some schools get better treatment then others; after all, they all use our tax dollars. They need to restructure the money and divide it evenly to all of the schools.</p>
<p><strong><em>RJ: </em></strong>Many CHA public housing high rises has fell prey to the wrecking ball and a lot of public housing residents has been displaced. Do you have any plans to address this issue?</p>
<p><strong>LJ: </strong>The thing about this is that the people didn’t receive the correct information - some didn’t receive no information,” Jones said. “Many people that live in the suburbs didn’t want public housing residents living there they didn’t have resources to help them.”</p>
<p>Many ex-offenders are due to re-enter our communities. How do you plan to address their issues such as housing and jobs?</p>
<p>“The Governor has a re-entry program which is not worth a dime; if the federal, state and city don’t hire the ex-offender, how can they expect the little guy at the bottom to do what they won’t even do,” Jones said. “There are ex-offenders that have [committed] non-violent crimes…emergency housing services are needed to help them as well as the other ex-felons.”</p>
<p>Any concluding thoughts?</p>
<p>“I think that our readers need to be educated on what each officials does - such as an alderman, senator, and congressman. Then they can hold each one of them responsible,” Jones said.</p>
<p><strong><em>RJ </em></strong>also interviewed Ranoule Tatum.</p>
<p>Why should the people in the district vote for you?</p>
<p>“Because I have a strong background in education as a classroom teacher and working in specialized programs to address the specific needs of our children,” Tatum said. “We need to look at education versus criminalization”</p>
<p>Lately in Chicago Mayor Daley is closing schools. If you became a state representative what would you do about that?</p>
<p>“One thing that I’m beginning to notice about CPS is that all the schools that are being affected are south of Madison   street in the African American community; only one is north of Madison Street,” Tatum said. “With the regentrification we know that a lot of these schools are going to fall in the hands of other people and not African Americans.”</p>
<p>“When I get into office I plan on getting together with other legislators…that represent areas that are being affected by school closing [so] that we can get together to create a block…so that our children can benefit,” Tatum added.</p>
<p>In this district a lot of public housing residents have been displaced as a result of the CHA’s Plan for Transformation. What would you do in order to address this issue?</p>
<p>“That’s only a clever word that they use, a plan for transformation, but what they are doing is resembling a plan for transplantation - you taking the plant out of one pot and so called putting it into a better pot [but] the people are the same plant,” Tatum said. “The plants are not changing; the people are the same plant. The people are not changing; only the locations are supposed to be changing.”</p>
<p>“That’s a Federal [issue]. It’s going to require not only myself as a state legislator to address this issue but other legislators that have CHA residents in their district,” Tatum said.</p>
<p>CHA said that their plan is working. Do you agree?</p>
<p>“I do have some first-hand experience that it is working for some of the residents but not all because some of the people are getting lost in the shuffle,” Tatum said.</p>
<p>Many ex-offenders are supposed to re-enter our communities very soon. What do you plan to do to help them?</p>
<p>“I have been involved for well over 12 years…in a federal program for people transitioning back,” Tatum said. “If they didn’t get any treatment in the penitentiary then they definitely need supportive services.”		</p>
