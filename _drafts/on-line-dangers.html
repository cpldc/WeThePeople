				South Shore School of Leadership senior Brittney Walter, 19, was sitting at her computer when she got a message from an unknown person.</p>
<p>When Brittney checked her message, it said: “Hey gurl wat up with you?”</p>
<p>Brittney said she was surprised. She checked out the profile. She saw the age. He was 25.<!--more--> Many teens have been meeting other people from the Internet. According to statistics from the non-profit Internet watchdog Enough is Enough, 69 percent of teens regularly received personal messages online from people they don’t know, and most of them don’t tell trusted adults about it.</p>
<p>Brittney was surprised that he was that old, and when she denied the friend request, she got a message from the unknown stranger. The message said, “What up shawty.”</p>
<p>Brittney thought about replying. So, two minutes later, she replied and said, “Hi, wats up.” She was a little nervous because she wasn’t used to talking to an older guy. The day went on, and they talked and got to know each other a little bit more.</p>
<p>The guy wanted to come from out of state to see her. So when he asked Brittney if that could happen, she said, “No.” When she said no, he got upset and wanted to come out anyway, but didn’t.		</p>
