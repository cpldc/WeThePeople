<p>On Dec. 1, 2010, a group of us from the Urban Youth International Journalism Program group at the non-profit Imagine Englewood If… went to Martin Luther King Jr. Park and Entertainment Center, which includes a skating rink and bowling alley run by the Chicago Park District, at 1219 W. 76<sup>th</sup> St. When I first got there, I was eager to interview, and I was ready to bowl.</p>
<p>Aaron Myles, who has been working at the bowling alley for two months, is an expert bowler. He had been coming there to skate and bowl since he was a kid. His highest score is 287. He loves bowling, he loves his job, and he is a “people person,” he said.</p>
<p>Another friendly woman at the alley said she also loves bowling. “The object is to knock the pins down with the ball and that’s pretty cool,” she said. She said she had just noticed the bowling alley while driving by and decided to return with her son, who was there with her and was very excited to start bowling.</p>
<p>Nearby, two young women were bowling. They were there on a field trip with an organization called Team Lead ‘Em. The rest of their group was next door at the skating rink.</p>
<p>After conducting our interviews, we decided to have a little fun and bowl. I recorded my fellow student Cornelius Jordan bowling and he recorded me. I had a great time at my bowling excursion!		</p>
