				<strong></strong><span style="font-size: small;">I</span>'m hot on the trails of  the hottest candidates in this lukewarm election. Though many incumbents  are running unopposed, some sparks are flying in the Windy City wind  when it comes to this year's municipal race. One of the races that is  sure to be hot and sizzling and may cause a Chicago fire is the mayoral  race. Mayor Richard M. Daley announced his bid for re-election in the  last year, according to his campaign spokesperson, Julian Green.</p>
<div>"Our platform is called working together. Mayor Daley has been working  with elected officials, city and community groups, reverends and the  like to move Chicago forward," Green said. "For many years, the city was  divided but for the last 14 years, Mayor Daley has been bridging the  gap." <!--more--></p>
<p>When asked about what the popular mayor thinks about an activist like  the Rev. Paul L. Jakes running against him, Green said, "The mayor  thinks that anyone that wants to run should run."</p>
<p>Jakes, a West Side minister known for his protests against police  brutality, has taken his campaign into Cabrini-Green on the North Side  and into Bronzeville on the South Side. He has been spotted all over the  city looking far and wide for votes.</p>
<p>Jakes' campaign spokesperson, Edmund Abdullah, told me that his platform  could be found on his Web site. So I pulled up the Web site and found  out that his platform issues are housing, taxes, education and public  safety. His Web site states that Chicago is having a crisis of  affordable housing:</p>
<p>"Condominiums for the wealthy are relentlessly built while replacing affordable rental units. Property taxes rise, rents and land prices skyrocket, and low- and moderate-income people are forced out into the suburbs if they are able to move, or to the streets if not.</p>
<p>"Public housing is destroyed without the participation of tenants  without necessary social services. The homeless rate increases daily to  the tragic tune of 15,000 people on the streets every night."</p>
<p>In addition to Jakes, Pat McAllister and the Rev. Joseph McCaffey are also challenging Daley.</p>
<p>My next call was to find out about another hot race - the contest for  Third Ward alderman. I tried to get comments from incumbent Ald. Dorothy  Tillman but she did not return my phone calls before our deadline.</p>
<p>So my next call was to Tillman's main challenger, Pat Dowell, who is  currently the executive director of the Near West Side Community  Development Corporation. I asked her what platform she was standing on.</p>
<p>"My platform is to give back the voice to the community. For too long,  the voices of the community have been oppressed by Tillman. I plan on  focusing on those 6,000 lots that are sitting on the land vacant.  Tillman is selling (these sites) only to the wealthy.</p>
<p>"It's time that we start selling that land to regular people instead of  people with big money who end up making condominiums and pushing out the  current residents.</p>
<p>"We need to open up opportunity for rental housing and cooperative housing for those residents who wish to stay.</p>
<p>I will also keep my eye on the CHA (Chicago Housing Authority  Transformation plan and the people they are displacing. "They need  social services and more jobs so they can make a transition into the  private market. But without jobs, that transition is never going to  happen."</p>
<p>The last hot race I will focus on is the Fourth Ward. Fourth Ward  incumbent Ald. Toni Preckwinkle recently challenged the mayor with an  affordable housing bill. I wanted to talk to Preckwinkle more about this  proposed legislation but she wasn't available before our press  deadline.</p>
<p>I did talk to her challenger, Norman Bolden, who said he was challenging  Preckwinkle because of how she treated his properties. Bolden said, "My  platform that I'm running on is those 200 or so vacant lots that the  alderman is sitting on and not letting regular people buy into them.  Also, affordable housing is an issue. In the Fourth Ward, every  able-bodied citizen who has a desire for employment, a job, should be  able go receive one."</p></div>
