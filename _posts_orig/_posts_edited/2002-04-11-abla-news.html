<p>
				Many times when a person thinks of residents of  public housing communities, they think of them as down trodden, hopeless  and uneducated, people who have no plans, opinions, or ideals as to how  they want to live as individuals or families. The stereotypes are that  residents are isolated from society.</p>
<div>The ABLA Local Advisory Council (LAC), along with its president, Deverra  Beverly, other concerned residents of ABLA and various city agencies  are working hard to erase these negative stereotypes. <!--more--></p>
<p>Various meetings have been held to keep the residents informed. At these  meetings, residents have been allowed to make major input and educated  choices as to things that will make the future of the ABLA community a  viable one. These things are needed as the transformation of public  housing takes place in the years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong><br />
An informational Town Hall meeting of the ABLA Hope VI Revitalization  Plan was held at the ABLA YMCA. The session was sponsored by Telesis,  the company that's helping ABLA residents plan a viable community.</p>
<p>Warm weather didn't stop large crowds from attending this important  event. Many residents of ABLA as well as the community as a whole were  present.</p>
<p>The plans were presented detail by detail. The plans are that the new  ABLA will resemble the residential character of other mixed income  neighborhoods, with an individual unit for each unit and more open  space.</p>
<p>After discussing the overall image, the facilators branched off into  smaller groups to give more information and listen to statements from  the attendees.</p>
<p>Some of the main topics were health care, employment, education and  recreation programs. Residents as well as the youth of ABLA were  knowledgeable and spoke very fluently with great concern on these areas.  The facilitators listened patiently, taking down all information.</p>
<p>"Adamant" is the way LAC President Beverly described her feelings towards this huge endeavor.</p>
<p><strong>Another Program for Residents</strong><br />
At a recent press conference at Fosco Park near the ABLA Homes,   representatives from various city agencies, along with many ABLA  residents, and Mayor Richard M. Daley unveiled the Service Connector  Program, which is being administered by the Chicago Department of Human  Services. The program is funded by a $5.9 million grant from the CHA and  a $1.5 million dollar grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur  Foundation and the Chicago Community Trust.</p>
<p>Daley said, "This program will link residents within public housing  communities citywide to take advantage of job training, day care and  after-school programs with specialists who can help them maintain stable  family environments, where all (city) residents are one and the same,  not isolated. When you isolate one community, that community falls  behind. Today, were here with the full weight of every City of Chicago  agency and numerous community organizations to say that the isolation of  public housing residents is coming to an end."</p>
<p><strong>Good Times</strong><br />
Sunny skies, good food, dancing, and fun were just some of the things  that made this years 9th annual neighborhood festival at ABLA a  success.</p>
<p>The festival, held at Adams Park at 15th Street and Loomis Avenue - AKA  Deverra Beverly Street - was sponsored by the ABLA LAC, HJ Russell, the  Duncan YMCA as well as various city and other on-site agencies.</p>
<p>There were activities for children, adults and our seniors. There were  dance contests, train rides, games and more. The surprise was a Michael  Jackson impersonator who always entertains the crowd with his fantastic  stage persona.</p>
<p>The raffle was the event that everyone looked forward to. Over $10,000  in  prizes were given away, including televisions, bicycles,  back-to-school gear and microwaves. One lucky resident was so excited  that she jumped and hugged everyone near her when she won a 13-inch  television with a built-in VCR. As dusk fell over the crowd, some were  still dancing. The whole day showed that ABLA still knows how to throw a  party.</p>
<p><strong>Back to School</strong><br />
Proud grandma, long-time LAC member and ABLA resident Loretta Mason is  ecstatic about her granddaughter, Candice Mason. The young Ms. Mason, a  graduate of Rich Central High School, will be attending Arkansas State  University in Pine Bluff this fall. Congratulations to Mason and best  wishes for a successful college career.</div>
