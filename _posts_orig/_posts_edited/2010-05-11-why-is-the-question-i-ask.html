				On June 5, 2007 I found out my little baby brother Jeremiah was beaten to death. I was in the car with my father when I got a call telling me.</p>
<p>Why did this have to happen to a 15-month-old baby – my little brother? What did he do to deserve such cruelty?</p>
<p>Even though I didn’t get the chance to know him well, it still hurts when I think about it.</p>
<p><!--more-->When I saw the news coverage, it really had an effect on me. It happened so fast. Anytime something bad happens to a baby it makes you sad, but when the baby is a part of you it hurts even more. I didn’t know this would affect me as much as it has.<br />
The first half of junior year was the worst year for me, I didn’t want to live anymore. I felt like I couldn’t breathe and I was always sad. You try to hide the pain and heartache, but you can’t. I would be sitting in school and it would cross my mind that my baby brother died.</p>
<p>My teachers could see that something was wrong because I was falling behind in my work, I wasn’t participating and I was always sad, like my air had been taken away from me. My grades were dropping and I was no longer happy. I didn’t want to do anything, my world had just come tumbling down around me.<br />
I asked my mother Chereana what she thought about it. Jeremiah was beaten to death while she was at work. The funeral was on June 11. It was hard for her to speak about it, but she bravely answered me.<br />
“Jeremiah was my little man, he was so intelligent and happy and healthy, he was my baby,” she said. “He loved to give out hugs and kisses. That’s my baby and that will never change. My Jer-bear.”<br />
I asked her why she thought it happened.<br />
“It happened all because of jealousy,” she said. “Mimi, listen to me, if you have a child by somebody else, don’t let your boyfriend or friend guy come around your baby, because they might hurt them. I want to apologize to you for what happened to your brother. If only I was more protective…he looked like you with light skin, curly hair and brown eyes. With your daddy’s nose, mouth and curiosity, not to forget his handsomeness.”<br />
What did he do to deserve this punishment? He was only 15 months old, not a care in the world, a happy, healthy, handsome baby. When I found out about it I felt like it was my fault because I should have been there watching him.</p>
<p>But I have to remind myself it’s not my fault.<br />
I used to blame God, but God has his own plan for our lives and we just have to play the hand dealt to us. If God didn’t want this to happen it wouldn’t have, so maybe it was his time to go.</p>
<p>He got his call to go home early.</p>
<p>During different changes and obstacles like this you have to remember that what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.		</p>
