				<strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> The following article was written by a youth reporter who is a graduate of the Urban Youth International Journalism Program.</p>
<p>KS: Why did you come to this school?<br />
Ms. G: A professor of mine worked with inner city youth and his stories inspired me.</p>
<p>KS: If you could, what would you change about your classes?<br />
Ms. G: I would spend more time with my students so I could get through to them, especially the ones that need the most help<br />
<!--more--><br />
KS: Why do you think the kids like you?<br />
MS.G: To some extent, I think it’s because they see I understand their struggle and because that we open up to one another.</p>
<p>KS: Why did you choose to teach social studies?<br />
MS.G: I like to teach and talk about justice and I want to teach students that individuals can make a difference, even if it’s just a small one.</p>
<p>KS: Do you have any pets?<br />
MS.G: All Dobermans, Mr. Otto, Middle Puppy and Fergie (Ferg Berg)…rescued 4/08. My dogs by day, Doberman ninjas by night.</p>
<p>-Every day you take on hardship and adversity…you endure. You remain strong…keep going and still manage to smile. Because of that, I do not only teach you, you teach me too! You fill my life with meaning and give me a sense of purpose. Ms. G		</p>
