				<span style="font-size: small;">D</span>an Hynes, 35, is currently serving a second term as Illinois state Comptroller, according to Mercedes Mallette, deputy campaign manager and spokesperson for Hynes. He is married to Christina Hynes, a physician at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. They have no children.</p>

His experience as comptroller mandates him to pay the state’s healthcare, nursing homes, Medicaid and hospital bills first, then to use discretion as to which other bills to pay, Mallette said. Last year during the financial crisis, he made a decision to pay the bills of agencies and organizations providing services for the public, which were the hardest hit by the budget crunch. Many of these organizations were not able to meet the obligations to pay their staff. He also wrote the bill that created the Illinois First rainy Day Fund, to be used in the case of a financial crises, according to Mallette, who also said that, in Hynes’ experience as comptroller, he is conservative when it comes to resources and urges the state of Illinois to live within the budget.</p>
<p>Among his supporters are Cook County Board President John Stroger, and Cook County Commissioner John Daley, chairman of the Cook County Finance Committee and brother of Mayor Richard M. Daley.</p>
<p>On health care, Mallette said he is very concerned about the quality of health care for all Americans and will work to see that every citizen has quality health care.</p>
<p>On crime and violence, Hynes is concerned that everyone is treated fairly, Mallette said; crime in urban areas is certainly different than that of some other areas, and Hynes will address it accordingly, throughout the state of Illinois.</p>
<p>On housing, Mallette said he is a strong advocate of affordable housing for all citizens and will work to bring federal housing dollars to Illinois.</p>
<p>On welfare reform, he will examine how welfare recipient are faring after being integrated into the work force. He wants to help mothers move from welfare to work, Mallette said.</p>
<p>On his agenda is getting people back to work and out of poverty, reported Mallette. Hynes plans to address poverty-related issues by focusing on education–the lack of it–and health care. He also will promote the idea of women as entrepreneurs, and plans to crack down on dead beat dads, Mallette said.		</p>
