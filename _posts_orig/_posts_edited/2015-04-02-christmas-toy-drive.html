<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> <em>The following story was written by a student in our Urban Youth International Journalism Program. The UYIJP is generously funded by the <a href="http://www.mccormickfoundation.org/">McCormick Foundation</a>.</em></p>
<p>The first annual Christmas Toy Drive at Hamilton Park, located at 513 West 72nd Street, was held by Social Sound Production &amp; Entertainment Social Movement. The toy drive was an overall success! There were refreshments (cupcakes, chips and juice boxes) for the children to enjoy after they waited to take a picture with Santa and receive their gift.</p>
<p>The kids and their parents had to make a line outside, and then were sent in five at a time to sign a form and sign-in sheet so they can be reached after the event. This is way Social Sound Production &amp; Entertainment Social Movement can build a relationship with the families they helped. Once they filled out the forms, the children were sent to different tables, depending on their age, where they received a gift. After getting their gift, it was time to take a picture with Santa and other family members.</p>

<p>Following that, they went to another table to receive a cupcake, then to the next table to receive chips and a drink of their choice. This was a good event, it got everybody in the Christmas spirit. To see the look on their faces after they received their gift made me so happy.</p>
<p>“Next year, we can look to expand even more for our next Christmas Toy Drive at Hamilton Park! I'm looking forward to seeing more of Social Sound Productions’ involvement with the community in the future,” stated a volunteer staff member who was helping with the toy drive.		</p>
