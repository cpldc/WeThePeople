				Ethan Michaeli, Executive Director of We The People Media and Publisher of Residentsâ€™ Journal, recently published an article about our Urban Youth International Journalism Program in the Youth Media Reporter, an important publication serving those who instruct and direct journalism initiatives for young adults. The article was invited by the Youth Media Reporter through a coalition of Chicago youth media groups assembled by the McCormick Foundation, the major sponsors of our youth program. </p>
