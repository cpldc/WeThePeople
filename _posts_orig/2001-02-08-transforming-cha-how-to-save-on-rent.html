<p><strong> </strong><span style="font-size: small;">I</span> am all for redevelopment  and I am sure most residents are. I also would like to say that most of  the new private managers are really trying to work with residents. But  when it comes to the One Strike issue and lease compliance, I and other  residents I’ve talked with feel this policy hurts some residents who  really want a better life for the residents of CHA and to be rid of  drugs and gangs. Many Chicago public housing residents don’t know about  CHA’s Income Disregard Policy, which could benefit working residents by  keeping their rent low and giving them a chance to save money.</p>
<div><!--more--><br />
CHA residents are charged rent based on 30 percent of their income. For  example, if a resident has an income of $100 per month, they pay $30 in  rent per month.

<p> If a resident finds a job and their income rises, they  will have to pay more rent  unless they get the Income Disregard.</p>
<p>The Income Disregard is designed to help residents become “economically  self-sufficient by minimizing rent increases to the maximum extent  allowed by the federal, state and local laws,” according to CHA’s  Admissions and Occupancy Policy. In other words, residents who are  working or in a job-training program will not get an increase in their  rent for a period of time if they qualify for the Income Disregard.</p>
<p><strong>Income Disregard Qualifications</strong><br />
To get the Income Disregard, once a CHA resident becomes employed or  begins a job-training program, they must notify their property manager.  They must provide the property manager with the dates of when they  started work and provide addresses and phone numbers for someone who can  verify their employment or job-training participation.    The property manager is then responsible for verifying the resident’s  participation in the job-training program or employment and processing  the information given them by the employers and trainers.</p>
<p><strong>Time Period of Income Disregards</strong><br />
Once the property manager has verified employment or job training, the  manager is then required to process the income disregard according to  the applicable time periods. Every resident who is working or in a  training program will not get the Income Disregard for the same length  of time.</p>
<p>There are 4 periods of time allotted for the Income Disregard. If a CHA  resident is in a job-training program, the Income Disregard lasts for  the duration of the program. If a CHA resident is federally employed,  the income disregard lasts for the first 12 consecutive months of  employment. If a CHA resident is employed by the state, the Income  Disregard lasts for the first 18 consecutive months of employment.</p>
<p>An additional provision for the Income Disregard states that CHA  residents employed by the state and federal government will pay only 50  percent of the increase in rent for the next 12 consecutive months  following an employment income disregard.</p>
<p>The Income Disregard does not apply to Section 8 participants. CHA  spokesperson Derek Hill said the federal government did not make its  final decision last year as to whether the policy is applicable to  residents of the The Income Disregard Procedures can be found under the  Chicago Housing Authority’s Admissions and Occupancy Appendix D document  dated January 6, 2000.</p>
<p>Residents’ Journal is investigating whether CHA managers are following  the Income Disregard policy. Please call me (Mary C. Johns) at (773)  285-0200 x3372 to find out where to obtain a copy of the Income  Disregard policy or to report a manager that isn’t following the policy  or doesn’t know about the policy.</p>
