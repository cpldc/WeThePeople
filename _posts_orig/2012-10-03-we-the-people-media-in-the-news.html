				On September 27, Executive Director Ethan Michaeli spoke on WBEZ’s “<a href="http://soundcloud.com/wbez/afternoon-shift-157-i">The Afternoon Shift</a>” hosted by Rick Kogan with Republican consultant Chris Roebling and WBEZ political reporter Alex Keefe to discuss the state of the electorate – undecided voters, uninformed voters and turn-out during a presidential campaign.

The next day, Ethan was the guest of Ken Davis’ “<a href="http://www.cantv.org/VIDEO-Chicago-Newsroom-12-9-27.htm">Chicago Newsroom</a>” over the CAN TV network discussing the state of Chicago public housing with WBEZ FM South Side Bureau Chief Natalie Moore.</p>
