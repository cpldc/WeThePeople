				Residents' Journal/We The People Media is proud to announce the publication of "My Story," by Chantell Suggs, a graduate of our Urban Youth International Journalism Program. As a student in the program, Chantell wrote about life in Chicago's neighborhood. She has come a long way and we hope you will join us in celebrating her accomplishments at a special author event at Thalia Hall, 1227 W. 18<sup>th</sup> Street, this Thursday, July 28, at 5:50 pm.</p>
