				<strong> </strong><span style="font-size: small;">A</span>n Altgeld Gardens resident  and longtime environmental activist says residents of other public  housing developments should be concerned about potential health hazards  from the demolition and redevelopment of their communities.</p>
<div>"CHA doesn't hold contractors responsible when they're doing  demolitions," said Cheryl Johnson, director of People for Community  Recovery. "Maybe due to a lack of knowledge of environmental health  concerns."</p>
<p>For many years, Johnson and other Altgeld Gardens residents have been  very concerned about potential health hazards because they live in a  former industrial area on the far South Side.<!--more--></p>
<p>Altgeld Gardens' boundaries are 130th Street on the north and 138th  Street on the south, from the Calumet Expressway on the east and the  Calumet River on the west. Altgeld Gardens is located near numerous  manufacturing plants, former steel mills and waste dumps. The residents  have a growing concern about the number of deaths annually from cancer  and other diseases. The residents fear numerous deaths may be related to  their environment.</p>
<p>Altgeld Gardens was named after Democrat John Peter Altgeld, who was the  governor of Illinois from 1893-1897. Altgeld Gardens opened for  occupancy in September 1944. Altgeld is a low-rise housing development  consisting of approximately 1,400 row houses. It was built on land at  the edge of the city so many amenities had to be built for the  residents, such as schools, stores and medical facilities.</p>
<p>People for Community Recovery is an organization that deals with these  environmental issues. PCR was founded in 1979 by Hazel Johnson, a  long-time resident of Altgeld Gardens. Johnson has over 20 years of  history with environmental issues. In 1984, Hazel Johnson was joined at PCR by her daughter, Cheryl, who is  now running the organization since her mom retired several years ago.</p>
<p>Hazel Johnson started her campaign to get more information for herself  and her community. She noticed that all over the South Side, there  seemed to be higher incidences of cancer and other illnesses than in  other areas.</p>
<p>Hazel Johnson's husband died of cancer in 1979. He was a light smoker  and it was not medically proven that the environment he lived in gave  him cancer. But Hazel Johnson believes the environment could have been a  contributing factor to her husband's illness.</p>
<p>Johnson's efforts drew the attention of Dr. Reginald Jones, who was the  director of the city health department. He was amazed at Johnson's  interest in environmental issues so he began to help her. He gave her  information and referred her to various agencies and other sources of  information.</p>
<p>Johnson has received commendations from many sources for her hard work  and diligence in trying to inform her community of their environmental  surroundings, including a gold medal from the first President George  Bush  - the father of the current president.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 12898 on Environmental  Justice on Feb. 11, 1994. The Executive Order gives all citizens the  right to information about their environment. Residents of low-income  and minority communities must be informed and have the right to know of  potential environmental hazards. However, Cheryl Johnson said the  executive order does not allow any enforcement.</p>
<p>"Once you get the knowledge, you can't sue," Johnson explained. "That's messed up, isn't it?"</p>
<p>Cheryl said PCR is still disseminating information to residents. She  said that cancer and other types of illnesses still seem to be common,  everyday occurrences in Altgeld Gardens. In October 1999, current and  former residents of Altgeld initiated a lawsuit against CHA. The  residents are alleging that CHA did not do enough to address their  environmental health concerns. Neither side will comment on the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Johnson said PCR is aware of other hazards such as the demolition  currently going on in CHA communities such as the Robert Taylor Homes.</p>
<p>Johnson said there is a lot of lead, asbestos and other pollutants in  the air during demolition. CHA does not hold the contractors responsible  enough when they are tearing down those buildings, Johnson said. The  demolition puts dust and other toxins in the air that are not good for  people with any type of respiratory problem. Johnson said a lot of those  airborne pollutants can cause skin rashes and other health problems.</p>
<p>Johnson said CHA has not been very vocal about the health issues that might be present in Altgeld.  "CHA is in denial," she said.</p>
<p>Johnson said that in Altgeld and other CHA properties, the agency did  not consider the land's prior use and the surrounding areas. Even people  who purchase homes in communities near Altgeld such as Riverdale and  Dolton should be informed about the environment before purchasing  property.</p>
<p>Johnson said Altgeld and the near South Suburban area are part of the  Calumet Industrial District. According to Johnson, this area is a  "multi-media," meaning that there are contaminants in the air, water and  land. There have been factories, manufacturing facilities, steel mills  and other industrial businesses located in the general area. On the near South Side, Johnson said that demolition makes many  contaminants "airborne," which can affect any neighborhood in the area.</p>
<p>Johnson said that PCR is still giving out information about  environmental hazards but they handle related issues as well. They have a  lead awareness program where they try to inform residents about the  hazards of lead and how to deal with it.</p>
<p>Johnson said people should take precautions to protect themselves from  environmental hazards. She  said there are special cleaning procedures  that people should follow. Dust is a serious pollutant that must be  taken care of, especially by cleaning window wells.</p>
<p>Coming in from outside, a person can bring in a lot of pollutants on  their shoes and clothes. So they should wipe their feet thoroughly and  take their shoes off. People who work outside in water or soil that  could contain pollutants should change clothes and wash them separately  from their regular laundry.</p>
<p><strong>Victim of Her Environment?</strong><br />
Near Johnson's office is the Dorothy Gautreaux Day Care Center. It is  named for the Altgeld Gardens resident who sued CHA and the City of  Chicago for housing discrimination. Her case lead to the landmark  Gautreaux Decision.</p>
<p>It is ironic that while Johnson and other residents feel CHA is denying  the affects of environmental pollutants on residents' health, Gautreaux  died of cancer at age 41 before her case was heard in court.</p>
